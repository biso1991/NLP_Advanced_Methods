I can count on my hand how many movies are actually worth watching more than once and this is one of them. Isn't it poetic? A disaster film is itself a disaster. "2012" is another end of the world/destruction movie that Roland Emerich has become infamous for. Even though his films before were not that great, they did not feel like they had to be force fed to the audience like this film did.
Grab a few beers before you watch this one, you are going to need them...  If you liked "Independence Day" and disaster movies, you will love this movie. This had me sitting on the edge of my seat for half of the movie, and I think I found my 82 year old mother huddling under the chair. It's full of action, disasters, and I don't think appropriate for young audiences, because a lot would have to be explained to them. But if this is what the earth will become when the end of the world comes, I don't want to be here. Watch it, it's a good movie!! One of the best disaster movies I've seen in a long time. Maybe the Aztec's had something to their dates when they said 12/21/12...wow, does that mean we don't have to prepare for Christmas next year?!?! LOL  I don't understand all the pure hate shown for this movie. It's a disaster movie wrapped up in an end of the world storyline. Did anyone expect to actually learn anything from it? It's just entertainment. Mindless entertainment, really, but it's a fun ride. There needs to be a certain suspension of belief on the viewer's part. Of course it's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be suspenseful and take you for a fun ride, while trotting out some decent special effects. I didn't see it in the theater, so I didn't pay anything to watch it. I enjoyed it. I advise you not be put off by the somewhat rambling...totally picky reviews and give it a try. When the movie 2012 came out it was superb! A film about the planet finally crumbling to pieces while everyone is in a panic to try and run from it, this film has some fast paced action. Now they're several parts in the movie where you can see the green screen work, and no the acting through out the whole movie is not the best, but for what it is the movie rocked.
To add insult to injury, one of the worst lines in cinema history is uttered right at the end of the film. The only thing that let's this film down is the science. Ignore that and it's a very enjoyable film. I saw this not long after it's release but enjoyed it more the second time around when i wasn't expecting much from the experience but was pleasantly surprised.
Danny Glover is the US President who opts to stay in Washington. Oliver Platt is the realist but harsh Chief of Staff. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of the scientists who alerted the government of the impending doom but fearful that the rich and powerful will callously leave millions to die.

The movie starts off alright, not great, not even good. In fact it starts out like every other destruction movie ever made. I thought that was fine, there's not many ways to start a movie like this. But come to find out that the entire movie follows the same formula. That formula, if you haven't guessed, is "what did another apocalypse movie do? Oh okay lets do that." The fact is, this movie has absolutely nothing new to bring to the table AT ALL. It takes every little trope from every other action movie ever made. There is literally no new content here at all.



And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.


The first half is fun. Roland Emmerich has created a massive roller coaster ride. It's Moviegeddon. The science be damn... until the second half. Let's just say the whole ark thing is ridiculous. Even for a mindless popcorn movie, this is still too stupid.  With John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt all in the same movie you have to assume there will be some action, some anti-establishment messages and great performances. It does and it is a BIG movie with a lot of very ambitious CGI, and great locations. A very interesting end of the world movie that portrays some great heroics, sacrifices and humor. It would be easy to throw back a few beers and lightly watch this film, but you would miss a lot of the subplots the production company works very hard to weave throughout the story. Government cover-ups, assassination, conspiracy theorist. Full of Hero's and villains, the ending is satisfying and surprising. I loved it. I never have been disappointed in a movie with John Cusack. I remember when this movie came out how all the kids were lined up to see it before the world ended. Kids, nothing will stop Hollywood from making B-grade movies while you will pay for them, and that is what you have in 2012.

The plot is well planned and has a lot of variety which gives you the sense of a worldwide disaster, which is always good for this type of film. The graphics are good and there is a lot of action as well as on the edge of your seat moments.


And the Russian guy! I was waiting for Will Ferrell to come out and ask him if he had Peanut Butter in his mouth. Its that bad.
The storyline may not be very strong, but it is supposed to entertain us. And I was truly entertained for over two hours. This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.

But that is probably too much reality to be depicted in a movie - at least in an American one. Perhaps some European guy is going to make the sequel? I would go into the cinema and pay to see that one. Luckily I didn't do that with this movie. Some films are patchworks. This is one. And it starts with the Mayan apocalypse prevision in 2012 of course

The actors must have had their doubts during the filming, they seem so mechanical and predictable. They surely knew they were trying to polish a turd of a story.
Enjoy. The end is near.  The movie biblically illustrates the golf between compassion and unfairness that is in our world. Between the compassionate idealist 'Adrian Helmsley' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the practical, very unfair 'Carl Anheuser' (Oliver Platt). There are many scenes that depict one too many narrow escapes. You need to overlook the drive through the building. Focus on the concept, and battle of wills. In the story, Anheuser has taken charge, and it is set up in such a way that we are to not like him. When you began to know that the life as we know it was going to cease to exist. Helmsley asks Anheuser what he is going to do with his other ticket, that is, his ticket to survive. He replies 'Nothing', that it was not practical for his mother to get on board, and that his relationship with his girlfriend was strained, so too bad for her! Later you find out that he is involved in some sinister plots to get art work into areas that will be saved. How did they finance the building of the saving devices? Anheuser again. "Sir I have a large family, 1bill dollars is a lot of money?". "I'm sorry, it's 1bill euros". Anheuser orchestrated the sale of tickets! Of course all completely unfair way to make sure people survived, and the program was funded. But if you pay attention to the movie, without Anheuser, there would be no way the whole thing would work. Anheuser says "What life isn't fair? You can go give your tickets to some of the workers, if you want!" Of course the thought at that moment was ridiculous. In the end he makes sense. The guy is so wrong, unfair, but at the same time, one of the only ways the whole thing might actually work within the bounds of the 'suspension of disbelief'. Meanwhile Helmsley throughout the movie is trying to save as many as he can. He complains at the size of his cabin, yet it only appears to be about 12x10. Saying: "You can fit 10 people in here?" Helmsley has read and aspires to the novel written by the main character 'Jackson Curtis' (John Cusack) which is supposedly overly idealistic novel. At the same time in our real world, it is unfortunately the mean guys like Anheuser who get things done, and get ahead, and become heads of large corporations and/or countries, not the good people like Helmsley. Yes, it's a tad long - but it isn't really 2012 minutes - it just seems like it. John Cusack still gives an excellent performance as a family man trying to rescue his estranged loved ones (excluding the dork who has taken up with his wife) from a coming world cataclysmic event. The problem with these FX is that they go over the top: same as Twister, or the conclusion of Armageddon, where debris and rocks are swirling over the heads of our heroes, or smashing into their equipment but they escape--equipment intact--without a scratch. We can only suspend our belief so much. Here, in the early going, Cusack drives a car through a decaying city, miraculously evading destruction while buses, trucks, and buildings are crushed like paper dolls. (Give me a break).




Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.






The pluses for this movie include:

I loved the story concept and where they took it, the ark idea was really cool. For the most part the graphics were great and the cast picked for the film were some of my favorites, so as a fan I surely enjoyed it. Out of all of the "end of time" films that were popping out back 2009 this one was one of the best. I've watched this film over and over and again the film is not perfect it is just awesome. Well, I was surprised at the low ratings and scathing reviews of others! I'm yet to see a high-budget disaster / apocalyptic movie with both effects and storyline! As a HUGE fan of this genre, I waited years for the release of this movie for it's effects alone - I wasn't disappointed! Yes, the storyline was flimsy and unbelievable (as was much of the acting) but what do you want from this kind of movie? In a real-life global disaster of this magnitude, we all know the odds of a family all surviving together, finding a plane, finding ANOTHER plane and flying halfway across the world to crash-land in the mountains and then be driven to salvation in the form of modern-day arks, is ridiculous. But without this stupid story-line, we wouldn't have been treated to the amazing CGI special effects as the film would have been over before it begun.
The plot is based around a family where the parents have separated and the mum has a new partner. There is a large earth quake where they live as well as other major disasters worldwide, they all have to try and survive, which takes them on an epic journey.
The film is yet another Roland Emmerich blockbuster that boasts stupid CGI, pointless chase scenes with various vehicles, characters with melodramatic personal lives and mind-numbing dialogue (delivered by rather good actors, actually.) The villains of the film are the forces of nature themselves, along with corrupt officials who didn't prepare accordingly. The plot is twistless and follows random paths that lead nowhere.




Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.
Flippen hell you must be the worst person to see a film with. My opinion on this film wasn't the best of story lines, but the Director said himself in many interviews that he didn't want this film to be deadly serious, he just wanted to deliver entertainment and to just bring a bit of humour to the situation otherwise it'll be quite a depressing film. Might as well call it Shindlers List 2 or whatever.


I know it's an action movie and the principal cast are supposed to survive 'till the end of the movie but come on, were they supernatural or what? Only few scratches after all they went through. The bridges and buildings falling down and they passed in the car with no problem. It could be a little more realistic without all the drama: "we survive to everything no matter what".
McCarthy, after only a few flying lessons, is assigned as co-pilot, and already haven flown over Los Angeles where the ground is crumbling beneath them, he must now assist the head Russian pilot in flying this plane that is the size of three Concords. "It's huge!", McCarthy exclaims, to which the Boris Badinoff sounding Russian tycoon simply responds, "It's Russian." If you can get through Woody Harrelson's embarrassing performance as a stoner who first alerts Cusack to the pending doom, then try not rolling your eyes at the sight of Cusack's car barreling down a Santa Monica, California street where the road literally is exploding directly behind them. Then, there's the shots them driving or flying through collapsing highways (Goodbye, 10 freeway!) and various large glass buildings, and while exciting to see, it just gets to be a bit too much. Even more cumbersome is the efforts for everybody to get on the outlandish ark, which on DVD is much easier to tolerate than it was in the movie theater, because there's always the fast-forward button on the remote.
Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.







I was wondering why I love this movie and do not hate it. The simple fact that disgustingly rich and powerful people, that can't contribute at all in this "brave new world" lying ahead (politicians, royalty, oil-barons, Russian oligarchs) get saved should me make it hate.
The world is going to end, but fortunately, John Cusack knows how to save the day as a chauffeur for this rick Russian businessman. The special effects are everywhere as suddenly the world is exploding and these guys stay one step ahead.
The scientist in me would love to know how planes can take off of ground surfaces which are falling into the sea, then be seen trying to navigate newly-formed canyons in a state of flux themselves. And what is wrong with trying to fly OVER falling buildings? Another thing, why does everybody have to wait until the last minute (much less stand and stare at an erupting volcano) to evacuate? I never understood that.
It's funny that I write a review about some movie that could only age badly. Everybody knew already back in 2009 that it would.





Funny acting like everyone is "whoa whoops" like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..
Speaking of the scene were California was destroyed, it just didn't make any sense. There were buildings falling and explosions and the street was totally gone and somehow the main family managed to escape in a limo. I mean it just was ridic. Everything was totally ridiculous. Everything was destroyed except for some reason China (which is where the magic boats were that would keep everyone safe from the flood.) and for some reason Africa which they found out didn't even get flooded somehow.




The scenes are SO detailed and so realistic that if you were to watch such scenes as part of the evening news, you would have found them totally believable.



2012 is the kind of film where you must suspend belief at the door. There are things that will happen in this film that are just impossible to take seriously, you just have to deal with it. It's a movie.
And now I will happily part with this DVD. 2012 is definitely one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. No movie has ever taken the "Apocalypse theme" to the heights that 2012 did. Directed by Ronald Emmerich, the talented director behind The Day After Tomorrow and 10000 BC, this movie pushes the limits of modern CGI effects and action scenes. The pacing of the movie is great and never leaves the viewer with a moment of boredom. Along with the great action scenes, the movie also makes a great message of worldwide unity between peoples rather than money and politics. 2012 is no doubt Ronald Emmerich's biggest movie.
The breaking of buildings,the separation of the highway and the whole view of New York City in vain has been shot excellently.


I sat and watched this for free on TV because it was the only thing on. I saw Danny Glover and thought, "oh, I didn't know he was in this." I said that to myself about five more times. The cast is solid. The acting and characters, however, are not. I'm not bloodthirsty, but at some point I did catch myself disappointed when some of the most annoying and selfish little bratty kids survived. John Cusack achieved the award for Most Apathetic and Out of Touch father, while Thandie Newton received an accolade for Most Underwhelming.


The bright spot of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. He also happens to be the heart and sole. Without his presence, the film would struggle for that emotional connection that is paramount in any disaster flick.
I put this film on to be entertained and entertained i was! 2012 starts off with a bang with strange re-occurring events all over the world. The movie focuses on failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) trying to lead his family to nirvana in a world of disaster. When the global chaos finally arrives, a plethora of cheesy acting and deliberate stunts, failure hits this movie like puberty.
In this movie, Jackson Curtis, a divorced man with two kids, who drives a limo and is also an author, takes his children on a camping trip. It's there that he finds out that the world is going to end. He finds out that there are ships being built where you can safely live after the apocalypse. A ticket will just cost you about $1 billion. Yeah, so you know all the rich snobs are going to be the only people living on Earth. How depressing? Lots of stuff happens, including Los Angeles being destroyed and falling into a giant sink hole, whilst Jackson gets his kids, ex-wife, and ex-wife's current-husband to Yellowstone National Park. Then they fly to Las Vegas (I think it was Vegas) and see one of Jackson's clients, a Russian billionaire who just happens to need another pilot, and the current-husband just happens to be one. So they fly away whilst the city is destroyed. They fly over Hawaii, where they were meant to refuel, but the state is busy being destroyed by lava. That's super creepy when you know it could really happen. Eventually, the Russian guy and his family are taken to the ships and Jackson and his company must sneak onto the ship before they die.

And it ends with a lame love song...
Of course, if you a fan of the "disaster film" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year. The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic. It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including "Titanic" and "Cloverfield".


The pinnacle of ridiculousness is this scene: As soon as John Cusack finds the map that will save his family, a huge chasm opens up in the ground, and John naturally falls right into it. BUT never fear he manages to grab onto the edge in the nick of time and pulls himself up...still holding the map in his hand!!! Is this Emmerich guy an adult?? I understand he wants to take us on a nonstop roller coaster ride, but... If they would simply have made the earth open up a few meters away, instead of a millimeter, or they could make their getaway by a few seconds, instead of a quarter second EVERY TIME, it would still have been suspenseful, but plausible enough to not make you want to scream at the screen.
Anyone who saw the trailers and expected to see a National Geographic documentary about the end of the world deserves to be disappointed. This film isn't about being believable. It's about throwing the most astonishing 'what ifs' at you that they could come up with. What if the entire San Andreas fault (and all the branching fault lines) triggered at once? What if Yellowstone park erupted? What if... what if... what if... On and on it goes, one massive disaster after another. And you know what? It's entertaining to watch the spectacle unfold.
And, let's face it, as lame as this film's humour clearly was, no amount of cheap, Buddhist philosophy is ever going to be the answer for saving this world of ours.
The characters are laughably one dimensional and boring. The expression of the family is the same as ours when Gordon or anyone else dies. We're left sitting there going, "Okay, he's dead. No big deal." They expect us to be sad for characters that were more of semi-antagonistic characters and to just be okay over the death of a character we have spent the whole time watching.
While plenty of money was spent for CGI, editing, and props, the film does not deliver in these categories. Some of the CGI is impressive but at certain times the green-screen backdrops are uncanny and appear unrealistic. Speaking of unrealism- they drive a car out of a plane's hangar!
If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with "2012" a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities. Too Bad, So Sad. When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year. Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.
Awful movie - don't bother wasting your time. Gets me down totally. No happiness to it really  Roland Emmerich's 2012 is the complete choice for the absolute worst movie of 2009 because of the boring premise that tries to tell us that the 2012 doomsday that was supposed to happen wasn't and we already know that that it happened more than 1 year ago. When Roland Emmerich did The Patriot in 2000 I completely enjoyed it and hailed it as the best colonial movie ever made and this just leaves me with one question what was he thinking while making this true piece of crap. Think about this you have a good cast such as John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Danny Glover embarrassing themselves in this completely boring disaster flick and made me want to fall asleep while watching it and I never want to see it ever again in my life. Why are so many people hating on this movie? If read up on anything about it, it's a DISASTER movie! Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE "what if" on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.
And everything else about this movie is equally bad. Never ending cliches, bad dialogue, and disgustingly predictable action scenes. Of course, the US president has to be black. Of course, there is a dysfunctional/estranged family that will be brought together by the disaster. Of course, religious propaganda is involved. Of course, there are wealthy Russians and Arabs. Of course, there's a dumb blonde. Of course, the bad guy turns good in the end. Of course, you know right away who's going to live and who's going to die -- you even know when and in what order (yes, it's THAT predictable).
"2012" could have been so much more a better movie if only the writer or writers had bother to do there research more better.The only good thing about "2012" is that the were some world class famous actors in the movie, but even that is really see as predictable. I honestly don't get why people say this is a bad movie. I think it's quite enjoyable. I mean, I don't love it, but it is a lot better than many disaster movies before this. And when it comes to disaster movies, you don't have a lot of choice. Unless it's just one disaster, like Twister. This is one of the only disaster movies that I really enjoy that has several different themes. Earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, tidal waves, and other really cool natural disasters that people love watching but would never want it to really happen.
