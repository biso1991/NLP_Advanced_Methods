As a lover of disaster movies, this was a big let down. The special effects were excellent but the back stories and dialogue were disappointing to say the least. John Cusack is a very good actor but was totally wasted in this.

Most major disaster movies demand you to suspend belief a bit but this film took that to the extreme. Some of the films set pieces were so improbable as to be laughable.

Compared to higher quality disaster movies like Deep Impact and The Day After Tomorrow this comes across as laughably amateur. The ending like most films of its type is predictable and dull.

On the upside the scenes of destruction are well done and entertaining.

Overall I expected a lot more but there is enough entertainment (just) to merit further viewings. From Roland Emmerich, a man who likes to destroy things on screen comes the apocalyptic disaster film 2012. Its 2012 and the scientists have discovered that the earth's core is melting, the crust will shift and lave will spew out causing earthquakes and rising tides. Even the poles would shift.

Politicians, rich oligarchs, various royal families and a few conspiracy nuts know of the imminent disaster and have started planning for it by means of survivals arks being built in China. However a place in the ark comes with a huge price.

John Cusack goes all out to get his ex-wife and kids to safety by tagging along with a rich Russian.

Danny Glover is the US President who opts to stay in Washington. Oliver Platt is the realist but harsh Chief of Staff. Chiwetel Ejiofor is one of the scientists who alerted the government of the impending doom but fearful that the rich and powerful will callously leave millions to die.

The cheese-fest is dialled up to 11 as Cusack just escapes disaster by car and plane. Roads splits, buildings come crashing down, volcanoes erupt. Emmerich even blows up the White House once again amongst other landmarks.

Its like a roller-coaster ride but the characterisations are a bit paper thin, some of the effects look a bit too much green screened. A good end of the world flick with some tongue in cheek humour.  I would give this a 7.8 out of ten, but decided to round down. The characters are pretty good. Adrian Helmsly is easily the best. Charlie is enjoyable and the roles of Sasha, Jackson, and Adrian's friend there who I can't remember the name of. Then again, Jackson's kid Noah isn't that appealing to me and I feel like Anhueser's villainy is kind of forced. Beginning with the good, I was fairly moved by the scenes showing the deaths of the masses and felt like the whole issue is pretty interesting. The storyline was okay I guess, but sometimes I felt like things such as Jackson's strained relationship with his family detracted. The whole thing is a pretty good example of how human greed corrupts the world and how money is far too powerful a force in determining peoples' fate. Lastly, I think anyone in the mood for some weird humor should YouTube Charlie's apocalypse video because it's pretty entertaining. On the bad side, it's pretty predictable throughout. Gordon making three implausible takeoffs gets old, and you pretty much know that the Curtis family will all get back together by the end from early on. You can definitely see the same personality in this as in Independece Day, which is one of my personal least favorites apart from the performances of Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum. Another annoying aspect of the film is how Jackson and whoever happens to be in the same vehicle as him manage to survive everything. I estimated that he and his family should have died about thirty-five times all total. So in a way, I'm kind of surprised at how much I actually like this movie, because I can't really find a whole lot to like about it. For anyone considering watching it, it's good if you want something emotional or something that is easy to laugh at when there is no intent of humor. You know that one scene in Independence Day where the family barely escapes a wall of fire inside a giant tunnel, and just as you think the beloved Golden Retriever is going to die, it leaps to safety?

Stretch that scene out over 2 and a half hours, and that's my reaction to 2012.

Maybe because I've waited until 2013 to watch this movie that I'm a bit jaded. But to call this movie "awfully entertaining" is an overstatement.

I sat and watched this for free on TV because it was the only thing on. I saw Danny Glover and thought, "oh, I didn't know he was in this." I said that to myself about five more times. The cast is solid. The acting and characters, however, are not. I'm not bloodthirsty, but at some point I did catch myself disappointed when some of the most annoying and selfish little bratty kids survived. John Cusack achieved the award for Most Apathetic and Out of Touch father, while Thandie Newton received an accolade for Most Underwhelming.

**Spoiler** Really. Like, her dad dies, and she let's out a poorly time sob, and that's literally the last time she sheds a tear. She, like most of these characters, is then back to continuously droning on about themselves and cracking jokes like billions of people aren't suffering and dying slow deaths while she has the chance at life(one could almost make an analogy that Americans do that daily). **end spoiler.**

And the Russian guy! I was waiting for Will Ferrell to come out and ask him if he had Peanut Butter in his mouth. Its that bad.

The effects, while good, are beat into your head so much, you will watch with child-like glee and enthusiasm as the waves destroy the world. Whoosh! Splash! Boom! Yay! To sum it up with another comparison-- Its like the old school versions of Mortal Kombat where squeamish people and concerned parents would go into settings and turn off the "blood." You'd just be kicking each other in the face, throwing swords at each other, over and over, yet no blood. I don't get how a world ends, and 99% of humanity is wiped out, yet I don't see a drop of blood, a dead body, anything to imply something catastrophic is going on.  pretty much enjoyable film, he who idiots want philosophy from watching film, stick to books. why so serious. dun be stupid to critise sci-fi film. if you got too much time , dun waste it blah blah blah on such film. pretty much enjoyable film, he who idiots want philosophy from watching film, stick to books. why so serious. dun be stupid to critise sci-fi film. if you got too much time , dun waste it blah blah blah on such film. repeated, so what? eat me ?pretty much enjoyable film, he who idiots want philosophy from watching film, stick to books. why so serious. dun be stupid to critise sci-fi film. if you got too much time , dun waste it blah blah blah on such film. pretty much enjoyable film, he who idiots want philosophy from watching film, stick to books. why so serious. dun be stupid to critise sci-fi film. if you got too much time , dun waste it blah blah blah on such film. repeated, so what? eat me ? I generally like Roland Emmerich's movies. They're not great but they're fun. I thought Stargate, Independence Day, and even Godzilla, were decent movies. But I didn't particularly like 2012. There's really only one reason I didn't like it but it's a big reason: the film gives you no reason for you to care more about the main characters than the billions of other people who die. Yes, tons of innocent people die in other disaster movies, like Independence Day and Dante's Peak (probably my favorite disaster movie), but the vast majority of the human race isn't killed in those. I didn't care about the family. I did care about Gordon (he was the one who flew them out of danger in the first place, after all) and he's crushed in the gears of the ark. In fact, quite a few of the people who are responsible, both directly and indirectly, for saving the family are killed, like Woody Harrelson's character, the Russian billionaire and pilot, and the astrophysicist.

And I think one disaster movie cliche that needs to die is how a dog is given more attention than all the people who are dying as if an animal's life is more important than a human's. Again, Independence Day and Dante's Peak are also guilty of this and I didn't like it in those movies either.  I guess this is based on the Mayan calender thing. You know, the one that didn't happen. The CGI is pretty good. I wonder how many narrow, almost but not quite gotcha escapes can one believe might happen? I have a big problem with the plot of this film. They sell tickets to the rich to finance the arks, the huge vessels (?) intended to save a remnant of humanity by riding out the enormous tsunamis that will occur. The world is ending, who cares about money, print all you need, who will bring you to task? If you are serious about saving humanity you want the best, brightest, young, fertile people you can find plus some experienced crew and scientists, not the old and rich or powerful. Then there is the scene with helicopters carrying elephants, plus the on board one showing several live animals. Why? Use frozen ova and sperm. You can store a lot more species as well as higher numbers of each type thereby allowing more humans on board. John Cusack does okay in the lead role and saves everyone on board his ark at the last second. Again to many close calls to be believable. After things settle down the surviving humans end up going to Africa to start over, where we began. Entertaining yes but not close to reality. I am very big fan of American films and movies. However, I really think the American movie or film makers should stop making these movies such as "2012". We have already have so many similar movie and films just like "2012" with the same theme, story line, predicted out come and acting, and more. These movies and films are all set in the great USA and made by American movie or film makes. Please do discover something new to show your fans, please stop being so self-centred.

For now, my self and the world are becoming bored of these similar style disaster movies and films. "2012" is so similar to other American disaster films and movies that I predicted the whole outcome from start to finish. It was like in making this movie, they took so many bits from other American disaster movies and put them together to make "2012". The whole world know that London Great Britain was the centre of attention for hosting "London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games" for the Summer of the year 2012, yet London was only mention and focus on for one second, that was all. How, so self-centred can the American film and movie makes be, this is not good.

"2012" could have been so much more a better movie if only the writer or writers had bother to do there research more better.The only good thing about "2012" is that the were some world class famous actors in the movie, but even that is really see as predictable. I honestly don't get why people say this is a bad movie. I think it's quite enjoyable. I mean, I don't love it, but it is a lot better than many disaster movies before this. And when it comes to disaster movies, you don't have a lot of choice. Unless it's just one disaster, like Twister. This is one of the only disaster movies that I really enjoy that has several different themes. Earthquakes, volcanoes erupting, tidal waves, and other really cool natural disasters that people love watching but would never want it to really happen.

In this movie, Jackson Curtis, a divorced man with two kids, who drives a limo and is also an author, takes his children on a camping trip. It's there that he finds out that the world is going to end. He finds out that there are ships being built where you can safely live after the apocalypse. A ticket will just cost you about $1 billion. Yeah, so you know all the rich snobs are going to be the only people living on Earth. How depressing? Lots of stuff happens, including Los Angeles being destroyed and falling into a giant sink hole, whilst Jackson gets his kids, ex-wife, and ex-wife's current-husband to Yellowstone National Park. Then they fly to Las Vegas (I think it was Vegas) and see one of Jackson's clients, a Russian billionaire who just happens to need another pilot, and the current-husband just happens to be one. So they fly away whilst the city is destroyed. They fly over Hawaii, where they were meant to refuel, but the state is busy being destroyed by lava. That's super creepy when you know it could really happen. Eventually, the Russian guy and his family are taken to the ships and Jackson and his company must sneak onto the ship before they die.

Fun Fact: This movie was banned in North Korea.

Fun Fact: Seth Rogen turned down the role of Adrian Hemsley.

Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Remember how Wile E. Coyote always lived even when he fell off a cliff, or got run over by a train? This was about that ridiculous. The John Cusack character should have died 83 times in this movie. All I kept thinking about was how well it would lend itself to one of those "Everything Wrong With 2012" video commentaries. The last time I remember a movie being this implausible was Speed, and it left a bad aftertaste that's never faded. But that was at least an enjoyable flick.

Faster than a speeding bullet, more invincible than Evel Knievel, John Cusack's character has a knack for jumping chasms and being at the right place at the right time. Through luck, magic, miracles, superpowers, whatever, he makes one incredible split-second escape after another. This device is tremendously abused, not just in how close the calls are, but the sheer number of them.

At every turn, something goes hopelessly wrong (beyond just the natural disasters). But even that doesn't stop the charmed Cusack from coming out of it alive (by the skin of his teeth). And with people dying all around him, every single one of his family makes it. Every falling fireball misses them...every time they pull away in a vehicle or plane, a gorge opens up exactly where they need to go so they have to jump it. Over and over and over and over. There is no relief from the ridiculousness.

The pinnacle of ridiculousness is this scene: As soon as John Cusack finds the map that will save his family, a huge chasm opens up in the ground, and John naturally falls right into it. BUT never fear he manages to grab onto the edge in the nick of time and pulls himself up...still holding the map in his hand!!! Is this Emmerich guy an adult?? I understand he wants to take us on a nonstop roller coaster ride, but... If they would simply have made the earth open up a few meters away, instead of a millimeter, or they could make their getaway by a few seconds, instead of a quarter second EVERY TIME, it would still have been suspenseful, but plausible enough to not make you want to scream at the screen.

Their plane (since the charmed Cusack is on it) glides effortlessly between falling buildings. It's the end of the world and they're seriously low on fuel -- why do they never dump the weight of all those excess autos? But...they continue on their hopeless journey. In the end, they only made it because...their destination had shifted! What luck.

I saw the ship plowing into the White House in the trailer and thought I was in the mood for a big disaster flick, so I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin.

The FX were grand as you would expect or could hope for, and the acting was passable. The problem was with the script. The dialogue, the characterizations and the plot -- all dreadful. I cry pretty easily, but it was very hard to feel anything for any of the characters in this movie. Except maybe Danny Glover. They tried to make jokes but they weren't funny. Only Woody Harrelson's character was somewhat interesting.

The thing about selling tickets to the arks was played up as some terrible fault in humanity, but really how else were they going to get the money to build them? The governments of the world all cooperate quite civilly in the face of this impending catastrophe that would put men at each other's throats. They've gotta kill anyone who figures out their plan...yet they're not worried about any of the people who bought tickets leaking the info? Like what if someone declined the offer because they didn't believe the world was going to end? Oh, maybe they were killed as well? In the wake of the Japanese tsunami, one has to wonder with all the nuclear plants and toxic chemical stores how doomed they would really be no matter what..

Right up to the end, as the every-man-for-himself mentality would have been peaking, the plot did not let up on its ludicrousness. As the arks are taking off, forget that the clock is ticking and every second counts...forget that there will not be enough food/supplies and everyone on board could die and this all will be for nothing...Chiwetel's impassioned plea convinces every world ruler to let everyone on at the last second.

And it ends with a lame love song...

And now I will happily part with this DVD. 2012 is definitely one of the biggest blockbusters of all time. No movie has ever taken the "Apocalypse theme" to the heights that 2012 did. Directed by Ronald Emmerich, the talented director behind The Day After Tomorrow and 10000 BC, this movie pushes the limits of modern CGI effects and action scenes. The pacing of the movie is great and never leaves the viewer with a moment of boredom. Along with the great action scenes, the movie also makes a great message of worldwide unity between peoples rather than money and politics. 2012 is no doubt Ronald Emmerich's biggest movie.

Byron Shelley Injeeli I love the disaster movies. I love the thrill and excitement of not knowing whether your heroes will survive and wondering what I would do if the end of the world suddenly came upon us. With Deep Impact and the Day after tomorrow firmly in my top 10 films, I had high hopes that 2012 would be just as good, if not better than these incredible films with its use of the latest advances in cinematography. However a great disaster movie it was not meant to be, as a general film straying into science fiction it was enjoyable but not thrilling.

I think my main issue with the film was that normally there is a hero or a few heroes, who you are rooting for all the way through to survive. 2012 bills John Cusack as the hero of the hour, who realises just how important his family is to him. However although I adore Cusack normally, my heart just wasn't in it and while I want him to survive, it doesn't ultimately make a difference to me either way. The film also was jam-packed with action, probably too much so, nudging on the edge of believability, with cities crumbling within the first half an hour and whilst it was very dramatic, it feels that it's been drawn out and it's not until the last 45 minutes that you truly got into and felt your heart start to race.

My other issue with the film was the way in which some characters were portrayed. Adrian Helmsely was presented as a hero who argued back to his boss, who said that it wasn't right what they were doing and demanded that more people should allowed to be saved. As a scientific adviser he seemed rather inept with "temperatures are rising with incredible velocity" just one of the many unscientific phrases tumbling from his humanitarian lips. Carl Anheuser was shown as the bad guy, the one who tried to control who would be saved. This is all very well and good, but if this were to happen then I would argue that Anheuser is actually the one in the right. Human life needs to be preserved and to do so does mean some sacrifices.

Despite the incredibly dire nature of several aspects of the film I found myself actually rather liking it and am a tentative fan of the film. It does require a suspension of reality on the viewers part (but surely that's what films are for) and it does turn into an enjoyable film with a twisting plot that whilst it doesn't leave you aching for more does mean that the film seems to fly by as though you are strapped into a roller-coaster instead of sat on your sofa. The special effects used are brilliant and the actual plot line and ideas put into it are fantastic. The actors play their parts superbly, particularly Woody Harrelson and it is an enjoyable movie. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a scientist who warns the President that the world is in trouble. They decide to build massive arks to save the few and the world's treasures.

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a frustrated writer who works as a limo driver. His ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and his 2 kids live with her new boyfriend. A series of events convinces Jackson that something is wrong and the group goes on a long thrilling journey to find the arks.

The first half is fun. Roland Emmerich has created a massive roller coaster ride. It's Moviegeddon. The science be damn... until the second half. Let's just say the whole ark thing is ridiculous. Even for a mindless popcorn movie, this is still too stupid.  With John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Danny Glover and Oliver Platt all in the same movie you have to assume there will be some action, some anti-establishment messages and great performances. It does and it is a BIG movie with a lot of very ambitious CGI, and great locations. A very interesting end of the world movie that portrays some great heroics, sacrifices and humor. It would be easy to throw back a few beers and lightly watch this film, but you would miss a lot of the subplots the production company works very hard to weave throughout the story. Government cover-ups, assassination, conspiracy theorist. Full of Hero's and villains, the ending is satisfying and surprising. I loved it. I never have been disappointed in a movie with John Cusack. I remember when this movie came out how all the kids were lined up to see it before the world ended. Kids, nothing will stop Hollywood from making B-grade movies while you will pay for them, and that is what you have in 2012.

The world is going to end, but fortunately, John Cusack knows how to save the day as a chauffeur for this rick Russian businessman. The special effects are everywhere as suddenly the world is exploding and these guys stay one step ahead.

Put your reality hat in the closet for this one guys, which is pretty much what you should have expected going in. At the end of the day, if you want a movie with no real plot, stupid banter, sub-par acting, and good CGI, well, you have come to the right place. I watched this twice now, so I guess it's not terrible, but rather, an mindless way to spend 2 hours of your time without engaging your brain much.

Enjoy. I ended up watching 2012 on the small screen, although I regretted not having watched it on the big screen when it came out originally.

2012 will most likely not make you cry, or stun you with the most unforgettable performances you ever saw. However, the acting was sill more than decent, and the story kept evolving with time, but the true highlight of 2012 is the amazing visual spectacles.

The visuals in this movie are nothing short of astonishing, and as someone who watched just about every disaster movie out there, I can say that 2012 takes it to the next level, by delivering disaster scenes that will ASTOUND you with their realism.

The scenes are SO detailed and so realistic that if you were to watch such scenes as part of the evening news, you would have found them totally believable.

Some moments in fact were quite intense, even shocking (in an entertaining kind of way), which was all part of the experience.

There is no question that 2012's depiction of disaster is an astonishing accomplishment in film history and as such is a must watch (assuming that you like this kind of stuff, of course). The movie has a fight for survival story-line, delivers some nice action scenes, a lot of drama, a good number of intense experience moments, and even several emotionally charged moments which all in all make 2012 worthy of watching. You are guaranteed some exquisite visual cinematic moments that are rarely encountered if ever on the big (or small) screen. Well this is my first review on IMDb, but this movie was so awful I was moved to warn everyone not to watch it. I don't know how this movie ended up being so bad, but I feel like this was the major inspiration for the odd sci-fi flick Sharknado. Yup, it was that bad.

First of all there were like way too many characters. This was because the producers wanted a big enough character pool to kill off several main characters while still having a nucleus of important characters survive. What made this annoying is that there were so many seemingly unrelated characters that I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them at all. My cousin and I had a fun time trying to decide who was going to die and when. Because I didn't care about any of the people in the movie, when they were in tremendous danger due to all of California falling into a giant hole to the center of the earth it really was not that exciting. In fact the only time I was on the edge of my seat was when I was reaching for my nachos.

Speaking of the scene were California was destroyed, it just didn't make any sense. There were buildings falling and explosions and the street was totally gone and somehow the main family managed to escape in a limo. I mean it just was ridic. Everything was totally ridiculous. Everything was destroyed except for some reason China (which is where the magic boats were that would keep everyone safe from the flood.) and for some reason Africa which they found out didn't even get flooded somehow.

The climax was horrible. Paris Hilton's dog gets the royal treatment while tons of other people (including a lot of religious people) were shown being violently killed. AND THEN they all get in the boat and are in the water but OH NO there is a leak and the main guys family is drowning and five minutes after launching the boat manages to make it's way from China to Mt. Everest and almost crashes while the main guy dives under the water in an attempt to stop the leak and save everyone even though he might die and somehow everyone on the boat is able to him swim around and fix the gears on camera and when he manages to do it and not die everyone cheers because ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY ARE DEAD, BUT YOU, RANDOM GUY, ARE NOT SO I AM SO HAPPY!! Please do not watch this movie. 2 hours and 40 minutes! I almost couldn't sit though it. And the last line was about the main guy's 7-year-old daughter announcing that she no longer wears diapers to bed. Oh joy. A lot of people have seemed to hate this movie but if you just turn your brain off and enjoy the ride its actually very enjoyable. It is very intense and epic in every way. John Cusack does a good job as well does the rest of the cast. Some of the parts are in this movie are pretty silly but its still fun.

This movie is about a man who starts hearing about how the world is going to end. At first he does not believe it but starts to see signs and then as the beginning of the end of the world starts to happen he struggles to keep him and his family safe.

This movie has a really low rating on this website but it is actually pretty entertaining. It is a little bit long though however running about two and a half hours Saw it on TV recently. I thought that the interesting bit of the story starts at the end of the movie:

- The Africans tell them to bugger off because they have enough problems already.

- Half the people on board are military troops.

- Half the cargo is military stuff like weapons, ammo, tanks and probably even jets and missiles.

But that is probably too much reality to be depicted in a movie - at least in an American one. Perhaps some European guy is going to make the sequel? I would go into the cinema and pay to see that one. Luckily I didn't do that with this movie. Some films are patchworks. This is one. And it starts with the Mayan apocalypse prevision in 2012 of course

The apocalypse is coming. We know that. But we have to make it realistic and use the good old Christian myths again without saying so, at least not too obviously. So there is an explosion at the surface of the sun bigger than what has ever been witnessed before. That has the effect of making the core of the earth, or at least a greater proportion of the inner mass go up in temperature at a great speed, making this mass more fluid, hence liberating the tectonic plates and the continents.

That means earthquakes, tsunamis and so on. Our news are full of such events. Just make them bigger, more gigantic. Waves that are nearly 2,000 meters high and you have it.

Add to that Tibet and the Chinese. Noah can be repeated again: a remake of the arch and there we are. There will be three arks at the end, after the catastrophe, because we need a trinity somewhere. Without the Chinese nothing could have been done, and what's more they provided the work force, probably cheap, and the security forces to build the arks first and then to make sure only the people who have the proper passes can go on them. The world without the Chinese could not go through the apocalypse without any comfort.

The US president is black of course because in 2009 it was obvious he was.

A little bit of Buddhism does not harm but at the same time the only surviving Buddhist monk actually cheated the system with his brother, a lay person, to save their own parents, and end up saving a few more as stowaways.

Add to that a family situation and you have it all: parents divorced, the ex-wife has a new boy friend. The children of the broken marriage, a boy and a girl, are the perfect American reconstructed or recomposed family.

The catastrophe itself is nothing but special effects. They are funny, maybe impressive but certainly not frightening. So banal after all. We can imagine catastrophes of this type every day and some happen every other week.

The funny part is the end. The arks find out that only Africa has survived, with a pun on the Cape of Good Hope. Humanity started in Africa and it will start again in Africa. Marvelous. But rather simple minded.

Now and then some ethical questions are brought up, but they are so easy and the answer is so banal. In such a catastrophe those ethical questions would certainly not be the main questions. The main question would be to keep people from panicking or just plain hurting if not killing one another. It is nice to think that in such an extreme situation people would think of saving their neighbors. We can always dream.

Dr Jacques COULARDEAU  So, CGI effects depict the worlds' end spreading from L.A. to DC and eventually over the tallest mountains on earth only to leave Africa untouched? Every country agrees to do the humanitarian thing only to show the American authority caving to a moral majority which is not theirs? A plastic surgeon and a Russian millionaire die while a government underling and barely employed writer save the world? ...And how did the the smart scientists not know that Africa wasn't being touched while the Himalyas disappeared under water? Wow! The writer throws away all logic and probabilty while making a really fun disaster movie full of death defying action (well, death defying for some). All of that end of days drama to end with the revelation that the 7 year old daughter doesn't need to wear Pull Ups anymore? John Cusak is his usual likable hero, Oliver Platt is the authority bad guy who makes more sense than you'd like to admit and Chiwetel Ejopjer plays to government scientist do-gooder who is always where he can make a difference despite the logic that says his discoveries would have been made by about 30-40 scientists, doctors and politicians over time. A movie for the eyes, but not much for the brain....  Roland Emmerich has done a great job by directing and making this film and gave the big picture and clear idea about 2012 concept keep it up .He has the mastery in making films regarding whether and climate global warming and natural disaster films i own all the DVD films titles Directed by Roland Emmerich he is an artistic man and full of astonishment in his directions. Its a big deal.He knows how to use CG I and visual effects where and when he is the master of modern disaster epic science fiction films.I always admire such directors and their direction and their way to show something rare and unique in his films.I am waiting for such films in the future.  The movie 2012 had heaps-of-hype around it, and I finally got to see it after 4 years. My friends who had seen it said it was absolutely fantastic, and since they have pretty much the same taste as me in movies I trusted them. I rented it from my local library's movie section and watched the next day, after watching It. It started kind of slow, with all the bits and pieces, and eventually it just got boring. Soon after, though, the real stuff started happening. Explosions, People dying in horrific ways, buildings falling - all that jazz. For the first 90-100 minutes the movie was enthralling, and that was the beginning/middle, and eventually it just got to a point where it was still good and entertaining, but got kind of old after a while. I was hanging on until I got to the end, though, because I knew with a movie like this, the end must be awesome. I was right. I'm not telling you what it was, though. There were absolutely astonishing visual effects in the beginning/middle of the movie, and they looked oh so very awesome. Nice job, Mr. Emmerich and VFX team! Anyway, there were very few scenes in the beginning/middle/end of the movie that weren't awesome. Except in the end, I got kind of bored because it was long, and drawn out. Was it intense? Yeah! But it was just one of those movies that you really really like, but just want to end about 20 minutes earlier. The end was, hover, a subtle retelling of Noah's Ark, and that's really all I can tell you about this movie's end. There were some real shockers, too, and they will probably leave you in disbelief, if you are interested in the movie. By the way, only a 1 or 2 of my reviews have spoilers in them, so you should go check those out, too. The acting was everything you would want to have in a disaster flick, screaming, yelling, and tears, and everything else. You can really feel the emotions of the characters at times, especially with Harry who has a small role played by Blu Mankuma, a very skilled actor. The end was where the tired wall really hits you. It was good, don't get me wrong, but I really wanted to shave off maybe 15 - 20 minutes of the run time. My apologies if this is a bad review. I'm kind of out of it because I just went jogging, and before that watched a 158 minute movie that I'm reviewing right now. Anyway, I do recommend this movie to you if you like good movies, disaster movies, or are in the mood for some good, old -fashioned explosions. See ya! If I were to rate this movie strictly on science or believability it would be a 2, but ultimately I found 2012 to be rather entertaining. The CGI was superb throughout, and surprisingly the acting was OK, but the story itself was not so hot and very overdone. If you want scenes of total devastation and cataclysm this outing will thrill you, for the CGI is superb and almost terrifyingly realistic.

While the story itself is lacking, you can at least relate it to the headlines in the news sometimes. It is the ultimate disaster movie no doubt, and if you leave your cape of reality at home you can enjoy it thoroughly...  For me, the movie was... disarming. Acting was fairly OK, but the whole action was leading me to hope for the lives of the main characters. As i watched the movie for a second time (aired on local TV) i realized that viewers (or, at least, i) aren't really supposed to care for the millions of lives lost during the destruction of whole cities - at least, as long as the plane of the main characters makes it. Of course, with the exception of the ship sinking. Those being said, i enjoyed the movie but i feel that the director should have obtained a bit more drama out of - hell - the end of the world. The matter of the dysfunctional family seamed more taken into consideration than the near extinction thing. 2012 is almost a textbook case of what's wrong with Hollywood.

Why?

Because it very, very neatly showcases a particular perversion of the Hollywood system: What you have in 2012 is a story with a lovely, grand overarching theme--which I'll explain below. But the important idea here in my review is that you could very likely miss this theme because it's been slathered over with a thick, nearly opaque faux-buttery coating of pop-thematics and staid disaster movie over-production.

If the producers could have found it in their hearts to give the treatment over to a winning director whose sensibility (and aesthetic wiles) they could trust, some balance could have been struck and 2012 could have been a fine film.

So, what *is* that excellent-but-buried theme? I tell people that when you pry off the crap, you have a story about "ways of knowing". And, in keeping with grand storytelling tradition, these ways of knowing are discrete, can be counted, and are THREE in number. Which, actually, is kinda cool.

But all that is moot, given the decisions that the producers _did_ make; sorry to say.

Avoid it. This movie was the mother of all missed opportunities.

First off, I never once believed that the World was going to come to an end in 2012. But despite that, I still enjoyed this movie, its not a bad movie, it just could have been so much better than it is.

I am a Science Fiction writer, and there were several things that I would have down sooooo... different.

for one, I would have given this movie a proper movie title that would've given it a shelf life beyond 2012. I would have named it "The Great Cancellation" or something like that.

secondly, I would have those Ark ships as Space ships (as the movies has us to believe until they actually find them)...yes, I would have made those space ships. Then I would have ended the movie with those space ships blasting off into space, the survivors would've watched from space as the Earth's crust melts into liquid magma.... then I would've ended it with those space ships floating through space towards destination unknown......

If they would have done as I suggested, then this might could have been the beginning of a great new Sci-Fi movie series that follows the survivors of Earth as they look for a new home in the stars...that could have been an exciting movie series, but instead we are left with "2012" a movie that has amazing special effects, a short shelf life and not much more....Yes, this is the mother is missed opportunities. Too Bad, So Sad. When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year. Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.

Of course, if you a fan of the "disaster film" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year. The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic. It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including "Titanic" and "Cloverfield".

Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at "disaster". The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from "War of the Worlds" (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion. Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the "Arks" are chosen. What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction. Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.

Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that. It's always amusing to read and/or hear people going on about the realness (or better lack of it) of event movies like this. Something along the lines like: That (stunt) couldn't really happen in real life! Really? Is that all you got about this movie? It's not real? Isn't a movie "not" real by definition?

Writer/director Roland Emmerich sacrifices dialogue and depends on an almost comical story line to wow viewers with mega destruction. Sure the CGI, sound and special effects will sell a lot of popcorn and soft drinks. Even word of mouth will put people in theater seats. Just leave any semblance of real intelligence at the box office, lean back and hold on...and let your eyes feast on the powerful scenes of devastation.

A geologist(Chiwetel Ejiofor)has the facts and figures that prove validity in the ancient Mayan belief that the wold will come to an end in 2012. He at first will have trouble convincing the President's(Danny Glover)people of the pending doom; but a novelist(John Cusack), who just so happens to have written a book about the lost Atlantis, is an easier believer...and the story line has him and his family out driving and flying the massive earthquakes and tsunamis. And somehow cell phones periodically still work. The finale is actually clever; and as the story eases into salvation, heroic feats of bravery run from sappy to bittersweet. You do end up thinking you got multiple big bangs for your buck. As for entertainment, I really enjoyed it. I just don't know why some people hated this awesome disaster movie, for my a really great movie, is a movie that can be watched, again and again and again.

The special effects are incredible, watch it in HD on Blu-ray, pause the action sequences, there's just so much happening in each frame it's just amazing.

The story and plot are easy to follow, now and again, I love to just relax and watch it for the roller-coaster non-stop thrill ride it truly is.

I can count on my hand how many movies are actually worth watching more than once and this is one of them. Isn't it poetic? A disaster film is itself a disaster. "2012" is another end of the world/destruction movie that Roland Emerich has become infamous for. Even though his films before were not that great, they did not feel like they had to be force fed to the audience like this film did.

While it has amazing visuals of an earthquake breaking up Los Angeles and several thousand foot tidal waves that toss around Air Force One and the U.S.S John F. Kennedy, the disaster is also with the characters and the story.

The characters are laughably one dimensional and boring. The expression of the family is the same as ours when Gordon or anyone else dies. We're left sitting there going, "Okay, he's dead. No big deal." They expect us to be sad for characters that were more of semi-antagonistic characters and to just be okay over the death of a character we have spent the whole time watching.

The story is nothing more than a coincidence after a coincidence. Yes, other films have coincidences in them to move the plot along like C-3PO and R2-D2 being picked by the Lars Family in "Star Wars", but coincidence is the whole reason for the family's survival. They get a plane and Gordon is luckily a pilot. They fly to Las Vegas where they meet up with our main protagonist Jackson's boss Yuri who will not bring them with until he finds out he needs a second pilot so he has to pick Gordon. They are going to crash land but the earth shifts several thousand miles so they crash right by where the arks are being built and run luckily find a family whose son is on the arc who decide to pick them up. Then, Jackson can luckily hold his breath for ten minutes to dislodge an object that got stuck in the ark's door gear which was preventing the ark from turning on.

The acting is awful as well. Not much else to say with acting but on another note, there is no tension in the film. The escape from Los Angeles basically destroys that because we see how invincible the family is. The second they pull out of their driveway, the earthquake is right behind them and there is not one second where they almost fall into the cracks. The second they leave the road to get around a car with stereotypical slow old ladies driving, the road in front of them falls apart. They manage to dodge a bunch of falling cars and get through a collapsing building with it barely scraping the roof of their car. The closest thing to tension that there is is the plane losing the landing gear in Vegas and then them crash landing because for one second, you think the plane might survive. At least there was about forty-five seconds of tension in the film about the all out destruction of earth.

To add insult to injury, one of the worst lines in cinema history is uttered right at the end of the film. The only thing that let's this film down is the science. Ignore that and it's a very enjoyable film. I saw this not long after it's release but enjoyed it more the second time around when i wasn't expecting much from the experience but was pleasantly surprised.

Just accept the earth has a very big problem, sit back and enjoy the show!

Top notch action sequences and effects are worth the 8 out of 10 I've chosen to give this film. I was quite surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat a few times and engaged to the end.

I put this film on to be entertained and entertained i was! 2012 starts off with a bang with strange re-occurring events all over the world. The movie focuses on failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) trying to lead his family to nirvana in a world of disaster. When the global chaos finally arrives, a plethora of cheesy acting and deliberate stunts, failure hits this movie like puberty.

Chiwetel Ejiofor is the only reason you could consider giving this movie any sort of recognition. He portrays an average scientist who partially uncovers the expiration date for humanity. There is plenty of emotion that comes from the actors, but at some points in the film you are LAUGHING at how poor the scene is setup.

Johann Urb and Zlatko Buric are disgusting. It really makes you wonder how hard it would be to catch a role in a big picture. John Cusack loves to yell and curse but otherwise provides nothing to the film. The children are annoyances to what could've been some cool 'survival' esque parts of the film.

While plenty of money was spent for CGI, editing, and props, the film does not deliver in these categories. Some of the CGI is impressive but at certain times the green-screen backdrops are uncanny and appear unrealistic. Speaking of unrealism- they drive a car out of a plane's hangar!

Overall, 2012 was a failed conception of an apocalypse. You can see how bad it even was- it lost money in the initial box office as compared to budget. At some times you are bored, and other times you are laughing at how poorly scripted, acted, and edited this film is. The one thing that works okay is Chiwetel Ejiofor's actions of justice and some of the scenery.

4/10 When will Roland Emmerich and Dean Delvin learn? I guess when they finally run out of disaster ideas. They already ruined Godzilla, capitalized on global warming and had aliens take a shot at world domination. It's only natural that he'd hurry up make this film before a director with actual talent got a chance to. After watching those barely acceptable films, along with "10, 000 B.C." in all its maligned light, I honestly didn't have high expectations for this film. And what a coincidence, the duo presented audiences with a predictable family melodrama weighed down by overly done action sequences.

I can't lie say there aren't some captivating and mouth-dropping shots, but the humor seems to never let up. Even as the world crumbles to pieces and society is at the end of its rope. A perfectly good time to tell a joke or two, don't you think? The same old formula of a divorced family getting back together after the step father is conveniently killed during the chaos is put to use, yawn. As a result I end up not giving a rat's *ss about any of the characters. In fact, it would've played out better if everyone would've simply died. How many cliches and comedy must I suffer? If the film had been marketed as a comedy then I would've honestly given it a higher score (maybe a 5 or 6) but instead it was portrayed in trailers as the end of all epicness. What a laugh. For about a third of this two and a half hour follow-up to "The Day After Tomorrow", the audience must suffer through another soap opera plot, this time even more abrasively presented than its predecessor. It involves a divorced couple (John Cusack and Amanda Peet) trying to get their children to safety with the help of Peet's fiancee (Thomas McCarthy) when underground volcanoes begin to decimate L.A. and the rest of the world. They discover that the powerful leaders and the money men supporters have gotten together to build arks to save themselves from an oncoming flood. OK, fine premise so far, but there is so much silliness in the way that the plot is drawn, and especially with a powerful Russian businessman, his two Pugsly Addams like twin sons, his much younger mistress, and his personal pilot who's obviously having an affair with the mistress.

McCarthy, after only a few flying lessons, is assigned as co-pilot, and already haven flown over Los Angeles where the ground is crumbling beneath them, he must now assist the head Russian pilot in flying this plane that is the size of three Concords. "It's huge!", McCarthy exclaims, to which the Boris Badinoff sounding Russian tycoon simply responds, "It's Russian." If you can get through Woody Harrelson's embarrassing performance as a stoner who first alerts Cusack to the pending doom, then try not rolling your eyes at the sight of Cusack's car barreling down a Santa Monica, California street where the road literally is exploding directly behind them. Then, there's the shots them driving or flying through collapsing highways (Goodbye, 10 freeway!) and various large glass buildings, and while exciting to see, it just gets to be a bit too much. Even more cumbersome is the efforts for everybody to get on the outlandish ark, which on DVD is much easier to tolerate than it was in the movie theater, because there's always the fast-forward button on the remote.

Of course, three years past the paranoia of the real 2012, this has been proved to be a total falsehood, a fright-making exploitation with mostly one dimensional characters and one-note performances that make this a collection of cliches and ultimately, in spite of some riveting moments, a true example of Hollywood bad taste. Danny Glover manages to make his character (President of the United States) totally likable, but Oliver Platt is truly obnoxious as a government hack. Certainly, this was fascinating in its initial big-screen run, but doesn't play well with repeat viewings. Also, after watching L.A. being wiped out by Tornados (through the same director), seeing the Pacific coast go through this again makes me wonder how the director would explain L.A. being re-built within less than a decade so it could only be destroyed again. Ironically, one of my old office buildings in Santa Monica is seen sinking into the Pacific, a big chunk of that coastal city being lifted off its axis and sliding down like the Titanic in the North Atlantic. So even though I may not give the movie "two thumbs up" for quality, I can give it at least one for sheer gaul if not ingenuity. I seriously don't know what the others had expected to see from this movie. This movie has good plot, good acting, good effects and also moral values I suppose.

Although some of the scenes do not make sense, so what? As long as you enjoy it, it's a good movie, IMO.

This movie keeps me interested from the beginning to the end. It's satisfactory.

It's a good movie to watch it with your fellows and family. I gave it an 8 out of 10.

I highly recommend it. Roland Emmerich was armed with a $200 million budget, and this is what it produced. It's an easy film to dislike from an intellectual level, artistically as well, while the science fiction boffins no doubt had kittens where the science was concerned. It's also easily one hour too long in length, and come the second half of the marathon it starts to sag. There's only so many times you can watch your lead protagonists escape crumbling carnage - via various modes of transport - before the fun factor begins to wane. However.

The carnage effects are grade "A" stuff, eye popping and ear splintering, Emmerich is a master at this sort of thing, and with a likable cast comfortably chewing through the safe disaster film making screenplay, it's a very decent popcorn blockbuster. It also isn't afraid to explore some dark moments, all of which - while not all being a surprise - strike strong emotional chords. It knows its disaster movie roots and is happy to tug on them.

2012 made a $500 million profit, that's a figure not to be ignored. The blockbuster movie loving public lapped it up, they often love this stuff, they just want to see the world exploding and chases and crashes and humans imploding or being heroic. If you have to strip it bare on any sort of cerebral level, then of course it's naked. But fully clothed, attired purely in modern film popcorn clobber, then it's grand dramatic and exciting fun. And this even as you have to massage your buttocks at the two hour mark. 7/10 This is certainly in my top 10 films I have watched. I really like these types of films and this one had it all for me. There is a lot of twists and turns as well as a lot of action.

The plot is based around a family where the parents have separated and the mum has a new partner. There is a large earth quake where they live as well as other major disasters worldwide, they all have to try and survive, which takes them on an epic journey.

The plot is well planned and has a lot of variety which gives you the sense of a worldwide disaster, which is always good for this type of film. The graphics are good and there is a lot of action as well as on the edge of your seat moments.

I would 100% recommend. The apocalypse is coming and it is going to hit Earth in 2012. The ancient Mayan calendar predicts this apocalypse and some researchers do what they can in order to survive this event.

I remember people talking about the end of time once this movie was about to hit theaters and I find it amusing how much a movie can affect people. I'm not a believer of all the predictions of the apocalypse but I find the theories interesting.

This movie was not amazing but the special effects and scenes were top notch. Great acting, great plot and fantastic visual effects. Also I loved the concept of the movie. I have to say this movie is very tense. The disasters in it make you think, will the world really end this way? It's one of those films where it gets your mind thinking about the world around us and how natural disasters can and will happen.

The reason I give 2012 a 9 is it is a film where it makes you think, it makes you think about being prepared for disasters great or small, basically it's a movie about reality but its fiction. Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying. They do say it will erupt again in the future, but they don't know when? as for the earthquakes those are real, the shifting of continents? I guess a major event like that can happen? It did millions of years ago.

I for one liked the action in it, I also liked the fact that there was humor in it to break the ice of all the seriousness and drama. All the cast does a wonderful job, Danny Glover was excellent playing the President of the United States. John Cusack was good, but I feel they should have put a more action packed actor in it as the dad who saves his family, Cusack does not have action in him, but then again like I said he did a good job in the movie.

My favorite character was the crazy guy that was obsessed with the Yellow stone caldera, he made me laugh so much. But then again he was completely crazy and lost his life because of it. I feel like Gordon played by Tom McCarthy should have had a better ending to his life, like to save someone. The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings? If we were on three boats, trying to survive, would we open the gates and let others in? Or leave them? Makes you think about your compassion and humanity.

2012 is a thinking movie, it will not only make you jump out of your seat but it will get your mind moving about things. Makes you want to get emergency prepared as well. I give 2012 a 9. Greetings from Lithuania.

"2012" is a very solid entry into disaster movies genre. It has everything that one would like to have: great special effects, tons of action, larger than life main characters and destructions on a biblical scale. Hey, it's surely isn't the best picture of the year, but it does exactly what it promises, entertains us by showing end of the world and 2 dimensional characters trying to survive it. The master of these flicks Roland Emmerich have destroyed cities in the past pictures, but here he goes on total annihilation.

Overall, if you have somehow skipped this flick on it's release, you can safely check this one out you like disaster flicks in general, because "2012" has it all. I am surprised that at this moment, this film only got a 5.6 rating. I was going to rate it 8, but now I am rating it a 9.

I loved it its intense special effects, and its intense sound effects. After all, that is what big disaster movies are all about.

The storyline may not be very strong, but it is supposed to entertain us. And I was truly entertained for over two hours. This is a movie well done. There was a few dull moments, but overall, it is big.

I watched it on DVD, I should have watched it in a big theater with a big screen. The special effects were purely amazing! One problem with this movie is its lack of Chinese people. After all, the ships were supposed to be built in China. There was no Chinese leaders or many Chinese people shown in the movie. Alright, I've been putting off this review just because this movie is just so damn bad. Before I watched this movie I thought "I like action movies, and destruction movies. Also the cast is decent." So already I wasn't expecting much but what I got was enough to start a real apocalypse.

The movie starts off alright, not great, not even good. In fact it starts out like every other destruction movie ever made. I thought that was fine, there's not many ways to start a movie like this. But come to find out that the entire movie follows the same formula. That formula, if you haven't guessed, is "what did another apocalypse movie do? Oh okay lets do that." The fact is, this movie has absolutely nothing new to bring to the table AT ALL. It takes every little trope from every other action movie ever made. There is literally no new content here at all.

So after the copy and paste plot, action scenes, and tropes, I start wondering why this movie was ever made. And it is simply to cash in on the popular 2012 theme going on right now and nothing else. This is one of those movies that i'd like to punch the writers in the face for making it. Not only is the entire movie predictable, but it's just stupid. I know John Cusack can act but he doesn't seem to care enough anymore. Probably because he knew how bad this movie was but realized he hasn't been in anything in a while and needed to stay relevant.

The ONLY 2 reason this movie doesn't have a perfectly bad score of a 1 is because frankly Netflix exists and the level of awful for movies has been taken to new heights. Secondly I was kind of entertained enough to keep watching even if it was just because I was thinking "So what trope are they going to use next... oh that one, okay." Also I like watching people die.  This is a Grade-A Disaster Movie, which means that human beings are put in jeopardy while their world falls apart: does anyone really take these things seriously? Some reviewers criticize Emmerich's films as if he were Ingmar Bergman, complaining about the lack of realism or about poor acting or thematic weakness. Why bother? These things are made as escapist fantasies, and Emmerich delivers. I suspect that most of us who really like an occasional escapist disaster, be it the old San Francisco film where everything falls down just after Jeannette MacDonald sings the title song, to The Towering Inferno, where everything burns up,again in San Francisco, are expecting thrills aplenty, and in this department, 2012 really delivers, with the earth's crust crumbling and spewing lava and tidal waves engulfing both the West Coast and Tibetan monasteries; John Cusack, with his air of earnest befuddlement is The Perfect Dad whose family is endangered, and there are lots of delightful cameos from such folks as Danny Glover as The President, and Woody Harrelson as a hippie broadcaster. This film is definitely not Citizen Kane or Nashville (or even Young Frankenstein!), but of its kind it's perfect, and delivers a cinematic fun-house ride with energy and dazzling imagery After patiently viewing all 2 hours & 40 minutes of this mega-disaster picture called 2012, I'm now completely convinced that German-born director, Roland Emmerich, totally hates the USA with a burning passion like no other.

With each subsequent disaster film that Emmerich has directed, he's made a point of destroying the States that much more. Until now, with 2012, there's literally nothing at all left of America to destroy. It's all gone, bye-bye.

And, I say, "Thank goodness for that."

By that, I mean, I hope that with 2012 Emmerich has finally gotten this hateful wrath of his towards the USA cleared right out of his system. And I hope that this will be the very last time that he goes to such extreme lengths (in one of his movies) as a means to get his hateful point across.

If you ask me, I find all of Emmerich's obsession with mass destruction not only screwy, but utterly tiresome, as well.

And, on top of all of that, I absolutely resent the blatant product placement which never fails to make its unwelcome way into just about every one of Emmerich's pictures.

In my opinion, all that these advertising plugs do is completely reduce said-film to the point of being nothing but an extended commercial, meant solely to showcase the consumer products that are conveniently being flashed in front of our faces.

All-in-all - 2012 was a truly terrible Noah's Ark story which actually seemed to be bent on turning all of the death & destruction (that it gleefully featured) into some sort of a perverse joke.

And, let's face it, as lame as this film's humour clearly was, no amount of cheap, Buddhist philosophy is ever going to be the answer for saving this world of ours.

*Note* - For anyone who's interested - Out of 2012's $200 million budget, Emmerich's modest cut was only $70 million. For both believer and non-believer, 2012 is a must-watch movie. This movie shows the unlimited power of our Creator, that can do anything on earth. How small and short our life is! Beside that it also shows the scientific advancement, human struggle to survive, love for family and dearest one. Really I think every time after watching the movie:

"who created us and why? from where we have come? what happens after death? any life more in universe? oh!"

We did not watch the Dinosaurs, Ice Age, Noah. But we have been watching WW2, WMD, Genocide, War, IS, Racism, Haughtiness and so on. If we want to save all the people of our earth, we should fight against poverty, disease, unemployment crisis. If we do not stop fighting each other, probably we will destroy ourselves before any type of real '2012 crisis'. The movie was fully entertaining , with all the stunning visual effects, explosions , the volcanoes , Tsunamis ...you name it. Rolland Emerich managed to put all kinds of disasters that can ( cant ) ever happen in the world together and managed to make a movie out of it.

The movie does have some ..infact many plot holes.. you cant just run away from an earth quake in a limo you should be lucky to have a wife whose lover coincidentally happens to be a pilot... you happen to know someone on the ship who can get you inside of it without paying the single penny... AND you have to be lucky enough to be working for Russian billionaire who is actually going to board the ship and can offer a ride in his plane..........

I should say John Cusack is the luckiest guy on earth if such a disaster happens.

But if we set aside all those things and watch it like movie ,,it is entertaining as hell..It is pretty much impossible but I loved the Earthquake sequence where John Cusack and his family escape in a limo.. Visual Effects were stunning and no one can deny that...

If you are looking for complete all action and entertainment flick then this is it... However if you are looking for a Shakespeare then please don't go for it... --- SPOILER ALARM --- In the end they find out that about the half of Africa is still there. And they go there, obviously because they want to land there.

Unfortunately that's the end of the movie ...

I would like to see the movie about them landing in Africa. And probably the Africans would have given those "immigrants", those extra mouths to feed the finger.

And then we would have found out that at least half the passengers are military staff and at least half the cargo is arms and ammo. And then heroic and pure Americans would have invaded Africa.

But such bitter reality is not for the Americans ... So Roland is not going to make THAT movie.  2012 (2009) is a science fiction film disaster that was released on 13 November 2009. Telling about the mayan prediction that will predict the earth will experience devastating disaster on December 21, 2009. Jackson frustrated man rescues his family from the catastrophic catastrophe that destroyed the whole world. Very good disaster movie. Stunning CGI effects. Excellent acting ... Forget about the story .. Enjoy  There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. The almost total non involvement with the characters, the fact that the constant disasters shown are transparently models or CGI so who cares if they are destroyed, the horrible music score, the casting of an ever more annoying John Cusack in the lead, the fact that many good actors are forced to appear in this kind of slop just to keep working. On top of all that it is way too long. The film makers have obviously forgotten the basic tenants of this kind of film, to have people you care about be front and center and have the jeopardy be something the audience can relate to at least abstractly. If your in the mood for a disaster epic watch The Towering Inferno or the original Poseidon Adventure instead!! What amazes me is the number of hugely negative reviews here for 2012, slating it for not being 'intellectual' or 'emotional' and so on. That it disregards the Mayan prophecies and so forth. This film isn't Shakespeare and it never pretends to be. This is pure popcorn entertainment - and not all entertainment has to be Jules Verne or Tolkien. Sometimes it's nice to just sit back and watch impossible things happen to perfectly normal people.

*Spoilers below*

Are there huge leaps of logic - a man with a few hours flight experience in a single engine plane able to fly a multi-engine plane and then co- pilot a huge cargo aircraft, for example - yes, there are. Sure, there's masses of stereotypes (bad guy turns good at the end, the estranged couple find renewed love in the light of a brave new world) and the number of near misses (at least three aircraft take off's from collapsing runways, getting the rescue ships engines running seconds before it is destroyed by slamming into Mount Everest) is staggeringly unbelievable. But guess what? This is about the complete destruction of the world in a matter of days, believability went out the window in the first two minutes of the film.

Anyone who saw the trailers and expected to see a National Geographic documentary about the end of the world deserves to be disappointed. This film isn't about being believable. It's about throwing the most astonishing 'what ifs' at you that they could come up with. What if the entire San Andreas fault (and all the branching fault lines) triggered at once? What if Yellowstone park erupted? What if... what if... what if... On and on it goes, one massive disaster after another. And you know what? It's entertaining to watch the spectacle unfold.

My advice? Grab a beer, turn up the volume, turn off the more critical aspects of your brain and just let yourself be entertained for a while.  My review for 2012 is very much overdue. I didn't review it earlier because to me it was perfect. Firstly, I had no problem with the movie as I am a number one fan of Roland Emmerich. I went to watch this for all the awesome effects even if some of them were a bit unrealistic as some would say. But hey, this is one of the best disaster movies of our time if you don't mind some funny bits. I gave this movie a 10 for all the blow it up stuff I always wanted. The story is your basic look at our hero of the day who just happens to be a frustrated divorced writer and drives a limousine for rich people. Not much of a story really although it tries to stick with it even after all the running around and getting on something in the nick of time. I know most of it was ridiculous, but I ain't stupid I just enjoyed it for what it was. An earthquake of that magnitude in this movie? You couldn't run, walk or even drive around like John Cusack did, and he wasn't even a professional race car driver. And I know from personal experience with earthquakes with lesser magnitude. But like I said, I came for the destruction and I got what I wanted and I hope Emmerich keeps doing movies like this forever. Blow up and destroy more stuff for us Roland!!!  I legitimately cannot understand why so many people would claim that this movie is so bad. This movie is truly incredible. I can only assume that the people who have given this a bad review have no idea how extremely and unimaginatively difficult it would be to make a film like this. Also, after reading some other user reviews I can only assume that many of them have not seen real earthquakes, tsunamis, or explosions; because they look unbelievably real in this movie, and yet some claim that the CGI is horrible. There was literally no part of this movie that ever looked fake to me, and I watched it on Blu-Ray. The sound mixing is outstanding, and if you watch the movie on a nice surround system it sounds truly amazing. The actors all do a great job too. I know tons of people who like this movie, but unfortunately most of the people who actually take the time to get on here and rate it are the ones who think they know everything, or that they could do better, or just the simple few who are not into disaster movies. This movie didn't make hundreds of millions of dollars by being terrible. Obviously there are going to be different opinions out there, but someone needed to stick up for this movie; because it is absolutely an amazing and spectacular work of art...and it's fun as heck to watch. Generally the movie was quite exciting. The narrow escapes in LA to get to the plane and even after the plane left the airport were great. Thank goodness there were no sex scenes as far as I can remember so as to further distract from the movie. The distractions and cuteness of the kids was enough along with the camping scenes.

I would argue that the end of the world scenario would have been more accurate from my point of view if the Earth would have simply been destroyed by being burned up by the sun or the Earth would have split into two parts due to the tremendous pressure built up inside of the Earth. That would have been interesting to see all the water and matter flowing out into space. The flood ending reminded me of Noah's ark. Surprised that Hollywood would bother to make a movie about the Mayan "curse" prediction of the end of the world--First, because there really is no prediction about the end of the world, and since its past 2012 now anyway, the whole premise seems pretty childish.

The other problem is the black lead actor with the ridiculous name--First of all, he's too ugly to be in a major motion picture of this magnitude, its quite distracting--Also he's not a very good actor, and for those 2 reasons is why his career, such as it was, died. Idris Elba would have been a MUCH better choice, a black actor who has some class, as well as being British.

Otherwise, most of the other actors were fine and the CGI/Special Effects were great.  I gave this movie a 10 just to bring its ratings up as a 5.7 is so unworthy of this film. It is a great movie for kids, teens and as an adult I think it is worth watching. Sure it is no great classic but defiantly better than what I see here in reviews as a lazy Sunday afternoon movie. I say it is worth a 7, not the best film I have seen but good entertainment, with a good script, good players and yes just a good watch. Not for those seeking an in-depth movie but its a 10/10 compared to the shark movies that adorn the screen these days. As I have said it is a watchable movie and when it was first released I would have pad to watch it and not felt ripped off. So watch it, make up your own mind, it's not the best in the world but if you like sci-fi then watch it. I cannot understand why many people rated this movie so low? they compared it to The Day After Tomorrow.. but the stories are entirely different. They are DIFFERENT in their own way! DAT is based on severe Climate Change. But that effects only parts of the world, There are ways for humans to survive. This movie is based on the Ancient Mayan Civilisations predictions for the date 2012. The emissions from the Sun has an effect on the earth-core which leaves practically nowhere for any type of species to survive. The fight for survival is much more intense in this movie.

I'm a big fan of DAT, I watched it 3 times! but 2012 definitely brings a lot more to the table... in terms of Visual Effects, the unique story, the way the Characters all tie in with one another. Yes, there are some miraculous escapes, but it's a movie.. if they made it 100% realistic all humans would be dead. That wouldn't make it a fun movie to watch now would it?.

Movies tend to do far-fetched things sometimes, thats what makes it interesting and sometimes even funny... i laughed so much when I saw them land at the right place at the right time, but thats what makes it entertaining too. If they died, that wouldn't make it much of a story.

I put off watching the movie, because of the bad reviews for such a long time... but after I watched it, I thought it was much better than people had given it credit for... watch it, and you might just be surprised. 2012 is undoubtedly Roland Emmerich's worst ever film, worse indeed than 10,000 BC. It's an outrageously bad movie, a bloated and laugh-filled variant of those late '90s disaster movies that proved popular for a time (DEEP IMPACT, VOLCANO, etc.) Clearly a labour of love for the director, who wrote as well as directed, I'm frankly incredulous over the huge amounts of money spent on this movie's production costs.

The plot, in essence, sees the Mayan prediction of the end of the world in 2012 come true. Yes, it's already dated, and yes, it leads to the same old disaster movie guff. Danny Glover's the shoe-in for Obama here, while the likes of Oliver Platt fill suits and Woody Harrelson frankly embarrasses himself as a conspiracy nut. Thandie Newton reminds you of why she hasn't been seen on screen since MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2; she's simply a not very good actress.

Best of all is the sub-plot involving John Cusack and his whiny/bratty kids. Cusack is like Road Runner in this movie, outrunning various disaster scenarios over and over again, until I lost count. He outdrives earthquakes, outflies volcanic eruptions, the list goes on. The special effects are admittedly spectacular - and the only reason to keep watching, I have to say - but the repetitive nature of watching Cusack escape from the brink time and again really shows off Emmerich's lack of creativity. Why not employ some help, somebody to use their imagination instead of simply repeating stuff over and over? Only in Hollywood! This was like a weird thing to do watching 'cause it was 18.12.2012 ..

Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.

This one was still very funny from the beginning, entertaining, didn't have to use brains (i took this as sleeping movie..) somehow i managed to watch this throughout from beginning to end.

Funny acting like everyone is "whoa whoops" like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..

The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more "serious" theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.

So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so. It does its premises and so .. nothing quite spectacular but yeah worth of watch :) If you take things too seriously or are afraid all the time in theaters don't watch this you miss the humor. Thats for me now, I have a Galaxy to explode. "2012" is actually one of the best disaster movies to date in my opinion. Sure it had a very generic and predictable storyline, but the visual effects outshines all other disaster movies. And that alone makes it well-worth watching this movie.

And as a disaster movie then impressive and realistic visuals are everything. And the special effects team were really delivering more than expected. It was almost as if the audience was right there in the mayhem, chaos and destruction.

Story-wise, well, then "2012" was as every other disaster movie ever made. Mankind stares total annihilation in the face and stands triumphant against impossible odds. Yes, a very generic storyline and one that has been used countless other times in just about every other disaster movie.

They had put together quite a good cast for the movie. Of course it was Woody Harrelson who outshines everyone with his performance as the oddball Charlie. But I will also say that John Cusack did quite well in this movie, despite being well out of his usual arena of movie genres. Oliver Platt was also quite good in this given role.

I have seen this movie a couple of times already, and every time I am equally blown away by the impressive CGI effects that are shown in "2012". This movie is a definite must watch for any fan of the disaster movie genre. My main problem with this movie was the fact that it was just so unbelievably unrealistic, full of cliches and seedy propaganda.

I found the scenes when the disaster strikes to be an insult to human intelligence. I mean, do you expect anyone to believe that, while the earth is destabilizing ALL AROUND AT THE SAME TIME, and we see hundreds of people and cars go to waste, the protagonist and his family have this magical ability to dodge every bullet, and they're the only ones in the whole city unaffected by the disaster and manage to get away safely while building are collapsing and the ground in moving? Right! How lame and unrealistic is that? It's so predictable and cheesy... there's no suspense whatsoever, and you are not simply bored, but also disgusted and offended.

I mean, the protagonist is a writer/limo driver, but he is portrayed as someone with almost superhuman powers. The ground is destabilizing under his feet, but he manages to save not only himself, but his whole family and the car + conveniently get to a plane and successfully board it while everyone else in the city dies.

And everything else about this movie is equally bad. Never ending cliches, bad dialogue, and disgustingly predictable action scenes. Of course, the US president has to be black. Of course, there is a dysfunctional/estranged family that will be brought together by the disaster. Of course, religious propaganda is involved. Of course, there are wealthy Russians and Arabs. Of course, there's a dumb blonde. Of course, the bad guy turns good in the end. Of course, you know right away who's going to live and who's going to die -- you even know when and in what order (yes, it's THAT predictable).

Honestly, it's just really boring a lot of the time. Like I said: zero suspense and zero originality.

Unconvincing, boring, lame = the three words that summarize it perfectly.

I thought that the President, as well as his adviser (the scientist) and his daughter were HORRIBLY miscast. None of these actors should've been in the movie. They're VERY unconvincing in their roles. Most actors in this movie are just really, really, really bad.

I hated the soundtrack, too.

I admire John Cusack; he's a splendid actor, but he couldn't save this disastrous mess. I think it's below his dignity to be associated with such a stupid excuse for a movie, so I have no idea why he agreed to star in it.

To add insult to injury, they brought in a Paris Hilton look-a-like (who plays a rich Russian dude's lover), and she gets a lot of screen time -- without actually serving any purpose (just like actual Paris Hilton). The movie seems to put a large emphasis on how important it is to save Paris Hilton and her purse rat. I'm not sure I understand what this is about.

I never really had high expectation for this film, but, turns out, it's worse than I thought. A huge disappointment. Shame on John Cusack for taking on the main role in this movie - must have needed for money!!! The storyline is ridiculous enough, but the CGI is really just laughable.

I would like to think this movie was made as a spoof of this genre, but horrifyingly it wasn't!!! Every cliche in the book was featured in this movie - including risking personal life for the sake of a beloved dog!!!

The acting is pretty dire from everyone! The movie really is an insult to most people's intelligence and should be avoided at all costs. I thought Jupiter Ascending was bad, but I'm not sure whether this one outdoes that!!!!! Personally I'm not going to waste my time pondering that thought! LMAO!!!!! Are you some kind of boring 90 year old man????? This has to be the worst review I think I've read on here and I've read a few! You're moaning about Close Calls???? IT'S CALLED GOD DAMN TENSION IT WAS THE WHOLE FUN OF IT! It kept you in the edge of your seat! Every bloody film has CLOSE CALLS. James Bond is probably the ultimate one which abuses this to the MAX yet it is fantastic! If this was meant to be REALISTIC as you think it should have been. Then they wouldn't have made it off the bloody runway and then they'd be a completely blank film without the main characters.

Flippen hell you must be the worst person to see a film with. My opinion on this film wasn't the best of story lines, but the Director said himself in many interviews that he didn't want this film to be deadly serious, he just wanted to deliver entertainment and to just bring a bit of humour to the situation otherwise it'll be quite a depressing film. Might as well call it Shindlers List 2 or whatever.

I found it extremely entertaining and I got my money's worth out of it. There was a lot of character development but it isn't Batman you're watching here it's the end of the world lol.

I went thru nearly every emotion. Happy, Sad, Terrified, Anger. No other film has made me go through so many emotions and those films are supposed to be called "Epic and Memorable" rating = [ 9 , 10 , 3 , 10 , 4 , 7 , 1 , 6 , 2 , 9 , 4 , 7 , 6 , 10 , 9 , 8 , 9 , 4 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 1 , 5 , 7 , 3 , 10 , 5 , 3 , 1 , 8 , 4 , 1 , 10 , 1 , 8 , 1 , 5  , 6 , 4 , 4 , 10 , 8 , 5 , 1 , 7 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 6 , 2 , 10 , 3 , 1 , 2 , 8 , 6 , 5 , 10 , 10 , 4 , 1 , 10 , 7 , 6 , 1 , 10 , 2 , 7 , 5 , 1 , 9 , 8 , 5 , 1 , 9 , 4 , 3 , 3 , 8 , 6 , 6 , 7 , 10 , 7 , 9 , 9 , 6 , 9 , 7 , 9 , 4 , 8 , 2 , 8 , 6 , 7 , 7 , 5 , 9 , 10 ]Bad Points

> Every single character is a stereotype > It's overly long, with lots of repetition in terms of the action > The underlying story is much more simple than the film makers seem to understand > They massively over do the "only just making it" action scene, there are about 10 of them > Nothing interesting happens at any point > CGI fest, you don't need that many scenes of destruction in a film > No real love interest > The All American speeches > The music sounds like it's been in about 500 different Hollywood films since the mid 90s

No real good points, but the acting isn't especially bad. Basically it's your standard awful family movie. I would have been really irked if I'd seen this in a cinema and had to sit through it all at once.

4/10 A typical Roland Emmerich movie - I expect his next oeuvre will feature special effects only and dispense with characters, story line and actors altogether. They certainly were undetectable in this one! Dumb and dumber was a celebration of wit and character development compared with this tripe. It seems that computer technology is sufficient for producing a blockbuster nowadays - I'm sure it made many millions.

No spoiler alert as the "plot"line and photos tell the whole story. What on earth were John Cusack and Woody Harrelson thinking? Bet they look back on this one cringing furiously...

I remember watching the original "Titanic" and "Poseidon Adventure" a long time ago and they both seem like in-depth documentaries in comparison - and that's saying a lot! LOL Good movie but not the BEST.

The special effects were OK, some of them looked really fake.

I know it's an action movie and the principal cast are supposed to survive 'till the end of the movie but come on, were they supernatural or what? Only few scratches after all they went through. The bridges and buildings falling down and they passed in the car with no problem. It could be a little more realistic without all the drama: "we survive to everything no matter what".

I suffered a lot watching this movie, I was struggling with myself to not cry, it's very cruel and it's sad imagine all this could really happen, see how everyone dies, everything is destroy and it shows once again how the people in this world thinks: the money and being an "important" person can save your life, the rest of us does not matter.

It's also a wake up call to everyone who lives in this planet. This movie is hilariously stupid! It's laugh out loud so over the top with its disasters happening and so quickly too and it takes way too long to get its message across. The only stars who hold the movie are John Cusack, Woodly Harrelson and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Thandie Newton tries her best with the female lead but isn't up to much. Oliver Platt boy do I want to punch him in his great big teeth or wish it was written in the script for one of the characters to do so. I know it's his character Carl that grates but do you not want to hit him in the whole movie with the heartlessness and just overall cruelty??

Awful movie - don't bother wasting your time. Gets me down totally. No happiness to it really  Roland Emmerich's 2012 is the complete choice for the absolute worst movie of 2009 because of the boring premise that tries to tell us that the 2012 doomsday that was supposed to happen wasn't and we already know that that it happened more than 1 year ago. When Roland Emmerich did The Patriot in 2000 I completely enjoyed it and hailed it as the best colonial movie ever made and this just leaves me with one question what was he thinking while making this true piece of crap. Think about this you have a good cast such as John Cusack, Woody Harrelson, Thandie Newton, and Danny Glover embarrassing themselves in this completely boring disaster flick and made me want to fall asleep while watching it and I never want to see it ever again in my life. Why are so many people hating on this movie? If read up on anything about it, it's a DISASTER movie! Not a Best Picture Oscar-winning film, not a perfectly acted feature, but a disaster movie; everything blows up, people die, and no one has (or should have) any clue of what to do as hell is being unleashed. That's almost what happens in 2012, and it works. I can see why some people do criticize aspects of the film, but if you don't want a disaster movie, go somewhere else; watch Schindler's List (great movie) or something like that. 2012 is a fun, intense adventure that is a HUGE "what if" on the supposed Mayan Prophecy.

The two main actors in this movie (John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor) stole the show, portraying the two main protagonists in this story about the truth behind the Mayan calender ending on December 21, 2012 that proclaims the end of the world is coming. The one character/actor that should have won critical appraisal for his role was Oliver Platt as the main antagonist; he believes the needs of the few surpass the needs of the many, which doesn't sit well with others.

Overall, with great CGI, decent to good acting, pretty good story, and some likable characters, 2012 is a fun and entertaining ride into the end of one world and the beginning of another. The big question that haters should ask themselves when reading this is, "What would you do when the end comes?" What i know is that you don't know what others would do if it did come. Therefore, the actions of the characters in the movie are plausible (except for some of the incredibly close calls).  I won't go on and on about the MANY things wrong with this movie. A couple typical examples will suffice. In no particular order, a large airplane takes off from LAX just ahead of an crumbling runway. The plane then travels all the way to downtown LA, a distance of a good ten miles and flies between falling skyscrapers. Considering the tallest building in LA is just over 1000 feet tall, you mean to say the plane traveled all that way and is STILL under 1000 feet in the air? Another example, all infrastructure has been destroyed... yet there they are, fall out to sea in an airplane... and their cell phones still work. One more, the Mayans predicted the world would end in 2012, yet while things were pretty messed up by the finish of the movie, the world hadn't really ended. And finally, there were all these arks constructed in a huge cavern, also constructed and it was all accomplished in under three years. That in itself is nor very realistic. But what really takes the cake is that these huge vessels, which are constructed to withstand practically ANYTHING, yet a few rocks fall from the ceiling and practically destroy one. WTF?! ...for now. In a year's time this film is going to seem extremely out of date. The end of the world plot is ludicrous, but it might have been easier if no mention of the Mayan calendar was made. The legend is obviously nonsense, and it would have been a much less silly film if it stood on its own two feet, independent of such bad science.

John Cusack (who is surprisingly good here) plays a failed, but good, writer working as a Limo driver for a wealthy Russian bully. When camping with his estranged kids in Yellowstone he discovers that the Caldera, the San Andreas Fault, and the rest of the world, are about to go down. What follows is more than 2 hours of utterly insane set-pieces, split-second escapes, breathtaking visual effects (which, for once, don't offend the eye), and lots and lots and lots of mega-destruction as Cusack and his family flee from the crumbling world beneath their feet by multiple means of improvised transportation. You've never seen a spectacle like this before, and it raises the bar ex-treme-ly high for any and all disaster flicks that might follow. Emmerich certainly knows how write action scenes.

Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.

I fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess. If we are all still here come January 1st 2013, then perhaps we should be grateful.  (33%) Largely a misfire from Emmerich that's so overstuffed that it crumbles under its own weight leaving only a bland popcorn movie in its place. The parts between all the action are mostly tedious and dull, with its half- hearted account of typical American life offering nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times before. The the world then goes to cock leading to some amusement park style effects ride as the family drive/fly through entire cities falling down around them in a manner that wouldn't convince a 5 year old. Then the focus is on giant arks created for the wealthy classes of the world to some how live on after these terrible events, but in reality no wealthy person will hand over any money for these super arks to be built because it's such a stupid , overly elaborate idea in the first place. Overall the movie is too silly to be taken seriously, and too long and dull to be fun. Where to begin. This move goes beyond asking you to suspend disbelief. It asks you to beat belief down, grind it up, stomp on it, then choke it down with vinegar. It is nothing more than a collection of never ending explosions, gratuitous special effects, punctuated with lame dialogue.

The actors must have had their doubts during the filming, they seem so mechanical and predictable. They surely knew they were trying to polish a turd of a story.

The writers did not trouble themselves with anything inconvenient like facts or real science when they created the premise or storyline of the film. They just made a bunch of stuff up that makes no sense, and blew up the world 50x over in CGI. I lost count of how many sharks were jumped in this travesty of a story. I cannot believe the writers did not go for the cliche dove with an olive branch at the end, but I suppose they were able to resist the temptation to be that predictable.

Grab a few beers before you watch this one, you are going to need them...  If you liked "Independence Day" and disaster movies, you will love this movie. This had me sitting on the edge of my seat for half of the movie, and I think I found my 82 year old mother huddling under the chair. It's full of action, disasters, and I don't think appropriate for young audiences, because a lot would have to be explained to them. But if this is what the earth will become when the end of the world comes, I don't want to be here. Watch it, it's a good movie!! One of the best disaster movies I've seen in a long time. Maybe the Aztec's had something to their dates when they said 12/21/12...wow, does that mean we don't have to prepare for Christmas next year?!?! LOL  I don't understand all the pure hate shown for this movie. It's a disaster movie wrapped up in an end of the world storyline. Did anyone expect to actually learn anything from it? It's just entertainment. Mindless entertainment, really, but it's a fun ride. There needs to be a certain suspension of belief on the viewer's part. Of course it's not realistic, but it's not meant to be. It's supposed to be suspenseful and take you for a fun ride, while trotting out some decent special effects. I didn't see it in the theater, so I didn't pay anything to watch it. I enjoyed it. I advise you not be put off by the somewhat rambling...totally picky reviews and give it a try. When the movie 2012 came out it was superb! A film about the planet finally crumbling to pieces while everyone is in a panic to try and run from it, this film has some fast paced action. Now they're several parts in the movie where you can see the green screen work, and no the acting through out the whole movie is not the best, but for what it is the movie rocked.

I loved the story concept and where they took it, the ark idea was really cool. For the most part the graphics were great and the cast picked for the film were some of my favorites, so as a fan I surely enjoyed it. Out of all of the "end of time" films that were popping out back 2009 this one was one of the best. I've watched this film over and over and again the film is not perfect it is just awesome. Well, I was surprised at the low ratings and scathing reviews of others! I'm yet to see a high-budget disaster / apocalyptic movie with both effects and storyline! As a HUGE fan of this genre, I waited years for the release of this movie for it's effects alone - I wasn't disappointed! Yes, the storyline was flimsy and unbelievable (as was much of the acting) but what do you want from this kind of movie? In a real-life global disaster of this magnitude, we all know the odds of a family all surviving together, finding a plane, finding ANOTHER plane and flying halfway across the world to crash-land in the mountains and then be driven to salvation in the form of modern-day arks, is ridiculous. But without this stupid story-line, we wouldn't have been treated to the amazing CGI special effects as the film would have been over before it begun.

I suspect that, as with Roland Emmerich's 'Day After Tomorrow', this movie was all about the effects with a lot of artistic license on the story line.

If you want a believable storyline, try 'Pride and Prejudice'. People always seem to be flaming this movie left and right because it's stupid or long or it has no logic... Everyone has something to hate about this film but the movie wasn't intending to be 'Gone With The Wind'. This is the essential Friday night movie.

Not Saturday Night but Friday Night. Sure, a lot of it is illogical and Rolland Emmerich graduated in the MTV style of directing college but, at it's heart, it's just a great entertaining popcorn movie. Even Bay has admitted that was what he was aiming at. And for a popcorn movie, it's a very strong movie indeed. The acting is impressive with Bruce Willis making you cry for real in that last scene of his where he proves to be the ultimate superhero and he doesn't even have to say "yippee ki-yay". Cusack is doing his nice hammy acting in this film but he gives a really genuine performance in a lot of the scenes. Liv Tyler is stunning and excellent as Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's fiancee. Billy Bob Thorton has a nice little role at the NASA headquarters. Steve Buscemi is the best part of the film. Funny yet still a great actor, this is one of his best performances. Michael Clarke Duncan is light in his role as one of the astronauts / oil driller and Owen Wilson lights up the screen just like in 'The Royal Tenenbaums'. That's only some of the cast that I'm going to list and those are the most recognizable names in the list. The script by 'Die Hard With A Vengeance' scribe Jonathan Hensleigh and 'Roadkill" and upcoming 'Superman' writer J.J.

Abrahams is fun and enjoyable with some real quirky dialogue and real funny bits. There are also some genuine moments of suspense and drama. The look of this film is obviously special effects orientated with the New York asteroid shower opening sequence and the destruction of Paris standing out. Of course, this film is just an enjoyable popcorn film and is actually deserving of it's place in "The Criterion Collection" of DVDs since it's that enjoyable kind of film that only comes along once in a while. But add to that the fact that there are some real sad moments and great acting in there and, there you have it, the perfect ingredients for a Friday night movie.  2012 really is a mixed bag. I liked the actors and their performances, including Amanda Peet, John Cusack, Woody Harrelson and more. The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012. Roland Emmerich has done it again. He seems to get a kick out of bringing out humanities worst fears and putting them on screen in all its glory. After destroying a large part of the world in Independence Day: ID4, and trashing New York with Godzilla, he decides to go the rest of the way and change the face of the earth forever and in the process kill off most of humanity. What is the enemy this time? Aliens? Nope done that. Monsters? Nope also done that. Bad weather? Once again done that. What is left? I know lets have the sun spit out solar flares that heat up the earth's core and destabilize the planet! Whatever his problem with humanity is, it translates well on to film. This is an epic disaster movie. No part of the world is safe and there is no magic quick fix here.

The film itself is simple, massive destruction minimal plot. But in this case it really works. With amazing effects and a great cast that includes John Cusack, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover and the story is played out well and the acting is good. It is not too over the top except the stand out performance from the great Woody Harrelson. He is your go to guy when you are looking for crazy, and once again he pulls off the crazy guy effortlessly.

I really enjoyed this film and I think it has been given an unfairly hard time by critics and movie goers alike. I don't understand what people expected from this film. It is a disaster film not The Shawshank Redemption! I expected disaster and destruction and it exceeded my expectations. I didn't expect award winning performances by the actors (many of who are award nominees and winners), and I didn't expect a plot more complicated than oh s**t, we are going to die what can we do? Many viewers and critics must have forgotten the other films by Roland Emmerich when viewing this or they were comparing it to other films that were released at the same time. However I judge a film on its own merit and not comparing it to films that are in a different category. As a disaster movie it doesn't get much better than this. polarity = [1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1] I don't know where to start? I gave it 2 viewings before coming back after a good nights sleep and had stopped swearing at the terrible stereotypes (especially the Russians, my god Hollywood types are dense). The script, if you can call it that is just ludicrous with nothing of note, nothing even remotely resembling witty, compelling, scientific or just plain interesting to keep a person in their seat. The visuals, well they looked clunky to be honest, the sort of wholesale destruction and amount of energy released to achieve it would have made most scenes a smoky grey ash haze but reality never intrudes in movie world so they were clear and clean and totally unbelievable as a result. I don't care how good your driving or your stretch limo is, you get amongst that lot for real and you die. I guess if hopeless pilots with box cutters can bring down steel framed and concrete high rise buildings in New York then sure, some plastic cutter can fly a twin engine slow plane through disaster even better than a limo can drive through it. From there it just gets worse, terrible stereotypes of the Russian billionaire and his girlfriend and family/pilot etc...yet Americans hate being stereotyped themselves so why do it? More special effects that wasted good computing power and money to achieve no impact and some cursory humanity to let a few unwashed masses aboard the arks in the face of the latest setback at that point. Why bother? like nuclear Armageddon the living will envy the dead. Another critic wrote that burning the money and filming it would have been more dramatic, I agree. Stay away from this unless you have eaten something bad and need to vomit without taking ipecac to get that started, this will do it for you! Please excuse me for delving into our political and cultural conditions to review this film. I know my hands are sort of tied that way as Hollywood can't help itself in using their neo-blockbuster movies to beat the rest of us over the head with their misapplied feng shui idealism.

You know how they go - fractured family realizes they belong together thanks to some unlikely disaster to befall humankind, the President waxing philosophical of their predicament as it relates to the issues of our day, humans are bad and need to die so that the rest of the bad humans who lived can move on while forgetting the lessons of the film, visual metaphors to underscore the moral of the story and lastly, not one iota of common sense throughout the movie.

What makes this one especially bad is that it catered to children. Not that child entertainment is a bad thing, but imprinting the fertile minds of young movie-goers with the supposed 2012 end of days tripe. They (who come up with such ideas for films) think they're smart enough to tell everyone else how to live while ignoring what they already should have learned.

The scientist in me would love to know how planes can take off of ground surfaces which are falling into the sea, then be seen trying to navigate newly-formed canyons in a state of flux themselves. And what is wrong with trying to fly OVER falling buildings? Another thing, why does everybody have to wait until the last minute (much less stand and stare at an erupting volcano) to evacuate? I never understood that.

Finally, the thing I most disliked about this movie is how it suggests that the United States has the market cornered on being bad even if the general theme was that all of humanity needed a reboot. Every country has a dark underbelly (its the cost of dealing with other countries which have the darkest of underbellies) and ours is no worse than any before it. I didn't appreciate the scene of an aircraft carrier taking out the President and the White House. I'll never understand how people can take such shots at a country they make a good chunk of change in. I think they should be banned from ever entering the borders, but that's just me.

I'm not religious, but the symbolic imagery of the crack forming between God and man on the Vatican ceiling didn't get by me. I get it Hollywood, the Catholic God is the only bad one. When you go after other religions I won't think of you as soft opportunistic bullies who've hijacked the freedom of expression to advance your political agenda against the nation which makes it possible.

Movies like this make me sick - even when I view them for free. This was like a weird thing to do watching 'cause it was 18.12.2012 ..

Humorlously I don't really care about catastrophe-movies never did and so.

This one was still very funny from the beginning, entertaining, didn't have to use brains (i took this as sleeping movie..) somehow i managed to watch this throughout from beginning to end.

Funny acting like everyone is "whoa whoops" like you slipped on floors or something when world is coming to an end, I laughed out loud. I guess that was mainly the idea ;) And the Mayans story, everybody knows the legend ..

The minuses: 1) TOO long. 2) first part of the movie was real funny and get me laughing a lot but then like director was changed the movie entered to more "serious" theme and that didn't quite fit in this humorous set. 3) Totally illogical :D .. but there also comes PLUS with it, this beats titanic lol .. you know what i mean if you watch this. Titanic was based on true happenings though.

So I guess 7/10 is not bad or so. It does its premises and so .. nothing quite spectacular but yeah worth of watch :) If you take things too seriously or are afraid all the time in theaters don't watch this you miss the humor. Thats for me now, I have a Galaxy to explode.  I like John Cusack. He usually makes some pretty good movies. This movie is a dog. I know movies stretch the imagination, but this one wants you to remove you head and not even think. The physics are just WAAAAAAY to hard to believe. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are nowhere near as big as they are in this movie. And its just a stupid plot all together. I was kind of late I watching this, I actually watched in 2013 on DVD. I must warn people who have OCD, this movie probably isn't for you.

So, my take on this movie is very cool CGI effects, cool sounds and you see building collapsing, volcanoes eroding and all that but in all honesty, beyond that - the movie itself is as many people say "a disaster".

What I found really unnecessary was Tamara's death. How let alone being really pretty, they just left her and forgot about her, showed nothing recovering her body at the end. She had screamed the top of her lungs going through that death. That was just too disturbing. It's a no- brainer as to why Emmerich wrote for Yuri and Gordon to die, but Tamara and Sasha - unnecessary. That would have been good drama to add.  first of all this movie is not for those movie geeks out here who think they are godfather of movie cinema.I mean this is a kind of fantasy disaster flick that has all the charm.I see funny reviews like 2012 wont be a disaster day or so...WELL what is your problem?? No body asked your expert reviews on the evolution and philosophy.If the director feels that Mayans should come,they come.If Africa stays,It stays.As if you idiots can decide the nature and shape of earth .Ya i guess it were you fellows who discovered gravity ,right? I never right reviews but this movie was damn underrated because people are sheep here. I enjoyed the movie and was thrilled until the end .GTFO to those who have extra brains.Go don't waste your time on movies ,you can only like brainless movies like Scott pilgrim. I salute the director's EFFORTS AND conclude it " A MUST WATCH " I really have to laugh when I read the negative reviews of this movie as if the writers were asked to give a critical review of a true piece of art. Let's face it: art films don't make money because they're not that entertaining films, and entertaining films generally are not artful. So what? I've watched 2012 several times on DVD and I am always entertained. I don't need to sit and analyze the science or even the dialogue. Yes, I like special effects but I also like survival movies. Sure, the protagonists seem to escape every possible death trap, but what would be the point of killing off these folks along the way. Then you really would have no story. I think that those who fault the movie, especially the plot, have not actually watched it beginning to end. I don't judge it in anyway other than what it sets out to do--entertain--and that it did for me. I am sure that all these negative critics, if asked how they would improve it, would come up with a number of changes that overall would not produce a vastly better movie.  With a hundred million f*cking dollars why is it hard to make a good movie? How is that difficult? It took more effort to make this movie a total piece of sh*t than had they made the movie good. Point by point from this movie's conception to the final stage of it's being, it's just bad ideas strung together. Who knew you could consistently link up bad ideas and have anything come of it? Usually a series of bad ideas ends in nullification or death, but not 2012, somehow it goes on. That is impressive. Zero plot multiplied by zero dialog divided by zero acting equals what? How many women were manipulated and deceived just so the producers of this movie could have sex with them? 2012? 2012,is an mind blowing piece.

Roland Emmerich known for making movies related to disasters does an excellent job.

The breaking of buildings,the separation of the highway and the whole view of New York City in vain has been shot excellently.

The only thing which I did not like was is its script.Its shoddy.

Roland Emmerich does an excellent job.Kudos to him.

The cinematographer does a very good job.

Performance wise-John Cusack is excellent.Amanda Peet is good.

Overall 2012 deserves a watch.  This movie is an insult to human intelligence, the world didn't even end in 2012! This movie sucks ass! The plot is horrible! The characters are fags! In addition, the world came to an end in the ending. What a horrible ending! This movie has got 5.8? WHAT THE HECK? This movie should get negative reviews! And a golden raspberry award!This is the worst movie next to Foodfight! I can't people thought this is awesome. When I saw the plot, it sucks huge time! It's sucks so much harder than Batman and Robin(1997)! This movie should get 0 on IMDb! This movie should be rated NC-17! Well, that pretty much it! 2012 sucks and so does food fight! Watch Michael Bay's Transformer films instead!  this film although was interesting it did lack some very important qualities, it is not the 21st of December, and there has been NO APOCALYPSE! i am very disappointed by this and i think that the producers have a lot to answer for, i was looking forwards to today being the day the world ended, but hey ho, the movie was good, it's not the best of movies but i believe that it is a reasonably good movie, i would have rated it higher than 6/10 but i am still slightly disappointed that the producers have lied to us about, what would have been, a most monumental occasion. i am pleased by this movie though, because i am amused by the thought of America being destroyed by a massive volcano eruption, followed closely by the rest of the world. The end of the world has never been so fun, nor has it ever been captured on film quite like this.

2012 is far from a perfect film, but it takes the disaster genre and amps it up ten fold. The script is light, but it does a nice job of setting the stakes and not confusing the viewer. The film builds the story at a good pace and pays off just at the right moments.

We get to know the characters we are supposed to and then all hell breaks lose. The special effect in 2012 are worth the price of admission alone.

2012 is the kind of film where you must suspend belief at the door. There are things that will happen in this film that are just impossible to take seriously, you just have to deal with it. It's a movie.

The bright spot of the film is Chiwetel Ejiofor. He also happens to be the heart and sole. Without his presence, the film would struggle for that emotional connection that is paramount in any disaster flick.

Chiwetel Ejiofor has been in some very good films including Children of Men, The Inside Man and American Gangster. He is an actor to keep an eye on.

In the end, if you are the kind of person that has trouble separating fiction from reality, then you should probably stay away from 2012. On the other hand, if your a sucker for disaster movies and just want a fun time at the theater for the price of a ticket and some snacks, then 2012 is where it's at.

Enjoy. The end is near.  The movie biblically illustrates the golf between compassion and unfairness that is in our world. Between the compassionate idealist 'Adrian Helmsley' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the practical, very unfair 'Carl Anheuser' (Oliver Platt). There are many scenes that depict one too many narrow escapes. You need to overlook the drive through the building. Focus on the concept, and battle of wills. In the story, Anheuser has taken charge, and it is set up in such a way that we are to not like him. When you began to know that the life as we know it was going to cease to exist. Helmsley asks Anheuser what he is going to do with his other ticket, that is, his ticket to survive. He replies 'Nothing', that it was not practical for his mother to get on board, and that his relationship with his girlfriend was strained, so too bad for her! Later you find out that he is involved in some sinister plots to get art work into areas that will be saved. How did they finance the building of the saving devices? Anheuser again. "Sir I have a large family, 1bill dollars is a lot of money?". "I'm sorry, it's 1bill euros". Anheuser orchestrated the sale of tickets! Of course all completely unfair way to make sure people survived, and the program was funded. But if you pay attention to the movie, without Anheuser, there would be no way the whole thing would work. Anheuser says "What life isn't fair? You can go give your tickets to some of the workers, if you want!" Of course the thought at that moment was ridiculous. In the end he makes sense. The guy is so wrong, unfair, but at the same time, one of the only ways the whole thing might actually work within the bounds of the 'suspension of disbelief'. Meanwhile Helmsley throughout the movie is trying to save as many as he can. He complains at the size of his cabin, yet it only appears to be about 12x10. Saying: "You can fit 10 people in here?" Helmsley has read and aspires to the novel written by the main character 'Jackson Curtis' (John Cusack) which is supposedly overly idealistic novel. At the same time in our real world, it is unfortunately the mean guys like Anheuser who get things done, and get ahead, and become heads of large corporations and/or countries, not the good people like Helmsley. Yes, it's a tad long - but it isn't really 2012 minutes - it just seems like it. John Cusack still gives an excellent performance as a family man trying to rescue his estranged loved ones (excluding the dork who has taken up with his wife) from a coming world cataclysmic event. The problem with these FX is that they go over the top: same as Twister, or the conclusion of Armageddon, where debris and rocks are swirling over the heads of our heroes, or smashing into their equipment but they escape--equipment intact--without a scratch. We can only suspend our belief so much. Here, in the early going, Cusack drives a car through a decaying city, miraculously evading destruction while buses, trucks, and buildings are crushed like paper dolls. (Give me a break).

The other problem is that these 'modern' directors/screenplay writers have forgotten the basic tenets of cinematography: 1) a scene must develop character or advance the plot, or you discard it (invented by Disney) 2) preferably, do both at once. In 2012, the action stops with resounding CLUNK while we stop to discuss Cusack's marital problems or his relationship with his kids. HEY DIRECTOR: WE ALREADY KNOW THE WIFE GAVE UP ON HIM TOO QUICKLY, HER NEW BOYFRIEND'S A DORK, AND THAT CUSACK LOVES HIS FAMILY - HE IS RISKING HIS LIFE TO SAVE THEM ALL. so, shaddup and get on with the story, will ya? I wouldn't pay to see this film. If you can catch it on TV, and fast-forward the commercials, give it a try - once should be plenty.  Seems to me they just took the story of Noah out of the Bible and added modern technology to it. Failed civilization. Warnings that are not believed. Selection of survivors. Water over the tops of mountains. Ark. All that is missing is the rain, the waters of the deep sure did open up. Actually, the Bible is a lot better. The CGI here is OK, direction is marginal, music is weak. Be sure to avoid the music at the end, it is just trash. How they ever decided to include that song is way beyond me. The movie's dramatic moments are predictable and weak. Some actions by characters are just stupid. There are massive plot holes; why, for instance, would rich people be able to buy a seat in the ark when money will be useless? Why did people stay behind for no apparent reason? The movie sure makes the point of the necessity for God sealing the doors of the ark, and not humans. All in all, a waste of time. Your time would be better spent reading the Bible and the story of Noah and not seeing this tripe. First off, I found that the attempt at humor at this time of destruction was unnecessary and weak. Mr Roland does this quite a bit in his movies when there is total havoc occurring and then 'tries' to break the tension with an attempt at humor. I honestly think this approach has made some of his movies seem silly. I mean, isn't that what we see these movies for? The tension? (Case in point also "Godzilla" and "ID4"). All these movies had great potential for the human element but instead focused on effects rather than the human scale of tragedy. These were not funny situations so why try to be funny? It fails in my opinion. Don't make a serious situation then lace it with laughs. Now if your are like a lot of viewers today and could care less about any believability, then this is the movie for you! If all you crave is explosions, earthquakes, tidal waves and the like then you wont care if the characters are/act stupid. But there are some of us out there who like the action but ALSO like some realistic approaches when it comes to people, not stereotypes & silly accents. Yes, this movie is about the end of the world, billions upon billions of deaths, disaster all around and it should be treated in a darker manner instead of like watching an afternoon matinee of Dagwood Bumstead. Its very hard to sympathize with any character since the script seemed to fail in every direction. I mean, why spend 200 million just to have people laugh and be uncaring? Effects, effects, effects is the answer. It seems all people want anymore is just a bunch of explosions on the silver screen. Some of us crave a bit more than visual stimulation. Now, like I stated that if its just "Bing Bam Boom" is all you want, then this is the flick but if you want a bit more of a human story then I would steer clear. I honestly believe giving this a 5 star rating is being overly generous. I leave it up to the viewer to decide. A marketing/publicity stunt made everyone aware that the ancient Mayans predicted the end of the world on 21 Dec 2012. This is the movie that cashed in on that prophecy. It turns out that the world didn't end, nor did the Mayans actually claim that it would.

The film is yet another Roland Emmerich blockbuster that boasts stupid CGI, pointless chase scenes with various vehicles, characters with melodramatic personal lives and mind-numbing dialogue (delivered by rather good actors, actually.) The villains of the film are the forces of nature themselves, along with corrupt officials who didn't prepare accordingly. The plot is twistless and follows random paths that lead nowhere.

If you liked The Day After Tomorrow you'll probably like this, too. When they made this movie, they were forgetting a fairly major point. If some distant planet is in danger of exploding, we might just identify with the few humans that happen to be there while it's happening. But this is not a distant planet. This is Earth in just a few months time from now.

The special effects in this movie are enough to make the viewer at least consider how awful it would be if this were really to happen. We see the planet fall apart before our eyes, and the realism is strikingly brilliant. The problem is, any concern we feel is for our own countries, our own people, our own families and loved ones. In my case, that's mainly western Europeans and South Americans. I feel for them as I see their homelands washed away under a sea of lava.

But that is not what this movie wants. It doesn't want me to feel concern for the annihilation of everything I have come to know and love. It wants me to care about Cusack and his nauseating family. I have very rarely seen a film in which I have desperately wanted the hero to die, but in this one I did. I want to know where I am, where my mother is, where my dog is, where my friends are... Cusack's silly little plastic Hollywood family is the least of my concerns right now as the world is about to end... I suppose we are meant to 'identify' with the lead family and imagine it was our own. But we don't. I would never want to wish my own family dead. Only Cusack's. Very often, movie reviews or threads start with apologetic sentences like: "...I also enjoy artsy movies from Stanley Kubrick and totally unknown, independent flicks from Europe."

Yes, indeed, me too. So, is it a guilty pleasure to like this movie? Well, no!

To put it as simple as it can be: "2012" entertained me. Me. I don't care, if millions of others did not feel entertained.

The thing is: I enjoy movies that are well made and so over the top cliche that they cannot be taken serious. Or movies that just parody movies like "2012"

Indeed, Trey Parker and Matt Stone wanted to do a shot-for-shot parody- puppet version of "The Day After Tomorrow" before they decided to do "Team America" - which tells a lot about the "quality" of Emmerich movies - they transcend the catastrophe genre.

At the same time I have to say that I also enjoy it because of this really basic, almost archaic "Apocalypse Wow" trope.

Yes, sure, the characters may be cheesy and cliche as heck. The whole movie is one big cliche.

For me, such movies - also movies like "Armageddon" - play in a certain parallel universe where the U.S.A. are the really good guys, where the president is a good guy, where the government is a "good guy" (even if they have to kill people off to keep the biggest secret ever, namely: Building super-arks to save a bunch of chosen people - and billionaires.)

In Emmerich movies, our whole, actually very bad way of life - the western way of life, the "American Way Of Live (TM)" is a good guy!

I was wondering why I love this movie and do not hate it. The simple fact that disgustingly rich and powerful people, that can't contribute at all in this "brave new world" lying ahead (politicians, royalty, oil-barons, Russian oligarchs) get saved should me make it hate.

But maybe the unspoken, off-screen fact, that they may be saved in the first place - but sail into a new world, where everything that has once been is gone - even the monetary system that made these rich guys pay their tickets (one billion Euros - not dollars - per person!) - so, what good will be a bunch of rich, old farts in a world, where the very first and basic things will be survival, building shelter and finding / growing food?

Maybe that makes me like it: 7 billion die - and around 300.000 survive - in three arks. What kind of "happy end" is that? There were rumors back in 2009 that there will be a TV-series about the events after "2012" - which never happened - and quite sure will never happen... it could only be cheap and boring anyway.

Watching this movie in 2014 makes it a bit less thrilling - sadly. I guess it was this subtle wave of "2012-mania" ...all this "it's the end of the world" frenzy that was building up towards the long awaited year 2012. And then nothing happened! How disappointing. We still live in a world, where a few chosen ones use up the resources and billions live in pure s***, have no clean water and no food, so a bunch of movie-geeks like me can rant about or praise movies like this particular one.

It's funny that I write a review about some movie that could only age badly. Everybody knew already back in 2009 that it would.

Back in 2009 even the worst "end of the world movie" had an aura of suspension and unconscious fear about THE end... now, "2012" is just another, old Emmerich product, well not "just" - it's entertaining. To me. And that is, what counts.

Because let's just take all these really bad rip-offs, these cheaply produced B-Movies with extremely bad-looking CGI and titles like "2012 - the end of the world disaster" or "Independence Daysaster" - where the only good and entertaining thing is the title. They have usually actors that were maybe famous 20 years ago - or aged porn-stars. And they are just bad - in a bad way.

"2012" is bad in an amazing way. It's bad in a good way. A very good way. The special effects are amazing. The actors act out the cheesy script in a funny way - heck, the whole movie is one big fun-ride! This is a formulaic disaster movie. The "science" behind it is downright silly. Every time the movie attempts to introduce a bit of science or technobabble, the movie stops because it makes no sense.

The danger is often silly and the rescue too far fetched. For example 5 dozens blobs of molten lava miss the minivan by centimeters, yet nary a one hits.

The pluses for this movie include:

1. no scrimping on CGI. Everything gets destroyed, parks, religious monuments, political monuments, cities, ships, airplanes, luxury cars, underground factories,...

2. It has a large cast. Even the bit parts are played by big name actors.

3. The child actors are quite believable.

4. Some reasonably interesting philosophical discussions about competition under conditions of scarce resources.

5. They play with stereotypes, then gradually dismantle them.
