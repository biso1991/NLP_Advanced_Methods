product. wakes me up every morning on time!', \"it's easy to set up and use. there are new features and skills added all the time.\", 'i purchased this on prime day mostly as a present for myself because i found having the echo plus on my kitchen counter to be overwhelming when cooking, cutting, cleaning, etc. especially when our counters aren’t very wide to begin with. after going back and forth between this and the show i decided on this because i felt it had all the same features but is more compact. i can honestly say i have no regrets. while i probably wouldn’t watch a movie i’d been dying to see on this, it’s a great way to listen to music, watch a quick youtube video, etc. i even attempted watching “jaws” on this and while it wasn’t the most comfortable thing for my eyes to do, it wasn’t as bad as one would think. i would definitely recommend!', 'up dated news', 'this device does not interact with my home filled with apple devices.  how disappointing!', 'i love my echo plus and have cousins from italy here visiting and they love it.  i want to give them each one, however will it work for them in italy. someone please answer my question asap.', 'i love all that you can do with the echo spot!', \"perfect! may favorite alexa device by far, specially if you own ring cameras or amazon cam's it does the job really well.  we changed our echo in the main living room and it seems to be more reactive. good job amazon!\", '', \"i love this little gadget, replaces my old clock basically, love i can listen to music in the morning get weather updates, news briefs.  let's me know when a amazon order is arriving & has been delivered etc.  yes it's a little pricey, but purchased it on amazon prime now during prime day and it was delivered same day for $99.\", \"i am having real difficulty working with the echo dot. alexi is not very smart. 9 out of 10 questions i have asked i get the &#34;i'm not sure&#34;  half the time i am still asking the question and alexi is saying &#34;i'm not sure&#34;. the music is great and works well for that. all in all so far it's been a very frustrating experience.\", 'this is 1 of 6 echo devices in the house and is currently being deployed as a bedside alarm clock.  i use it basically as an echo dot with a clock attached and may occasionally pull up camera video.  audio quality and screen quality are really are not appropriate for music or watching video.  much of the time it works well as alarm clock, but there are some serious flaws, particularly if you are the last one to bed or the first to wake.  it doesn’t seem like the engineers actually tested this in a bedroom with 2 people on different schedules.  try walking into a dark bedroom with a sleeping wife and waking her up by saying “alexa set an alarm for 5am” and then having alexa repeat “ok alarm set for 5am.”  not good.  i suppose you could whisper then fumble for the volume down button but that is stupid.  plain and simple, this device needs to be brought into the 1990’s and have simple touch screen interface added to set an alarm.  i know there is a cumbersome interface for these situations where one can set an alarm from the alexa app on your phone.  no thanks, if i’m picking up my phone to set an alarm i will just use its built in alarm and save a step.  at least the engineers allow the alarm to be turned off from the touch screen, so for example if you wake up a few minutes early you can cancel the alarm without speaking and waking your spouse.  the interface for using the touch screen to cancel an alarm that has gone off is however not great.  there should be separate snooze and cancel buttons.  currently a touch snoozes and a swipe cancels.  it is too easy when half awake to snooze when you think you have cancelled.  when the snoozed alarm goes off a few minutes later, my not amused and no longer sleeping wife will let me know by summoning alexa to turn off the bathroom lights while i’m in the shower.', 'all the music i can listen too, also the movie i can watch i can see my ring doorbell .', 'just the perfect cost effective solution.  thank you amazon.', \"use as my 3rd dot. bought so my

alexa to connect. fortunately, my sister was here with her apple cell. after an hour+ tech support fixed the glitches. we are up and running.', 'love it, we are still learning the capabilities, having a lot of fun.', 'very easy setup.', '', 'i love it, wife hates it.', 'worked just as good as the two new echo dots i preciously purchases.', 'i purchased the echo plus with built-in hub during prime days sale. it was delivered very fast and was easy to link to my wifi. also connected it to a smart plug to control a light. i love telling alexa to play music, and she hears me from 2 rooms away.

the top for volume control.  it was quicker and easier to just grab the top and twist without having to look at the buttons and find the &#34;-&#34; one and press it a few times.  i also wish the bass was a bit better.  all in all, it's a great device and i'm happy with it.\", 'super easy to set up.  easy to use. lots of app options available.', 'this was an add on for my echo system, the

asking. wife not happy...', 'a great product.  i would buy another.', 'works as advertised. speak clearly, and research the commands. also. get the wall holder, it keeps it out of the way. set up is a breeze, just make sure you are close to the device initially when connecting your phone. for some reason it made set up easier...though it could be psychological haha', 'i used to use my laptop for anything show watching, including netflix, but i am glad i bought this. this is super easy to set up and has everything you need with quick and easy access. definitely worth the buy.', 'great product at a great price.', 'i love this as a second &#34;alexa&#34; in our bedroom.  great for checking weather, for meditation music, and as a timer - perfect for my husband who has to use eye drops

dented, so i will be exchanging it.  i like the screen and many of the features so i will not be getting a refund.  it was still worth the price.', 'it works great', 'did t really know what i could use this device for. used it for a few things, but need an overview', 'cool little piece of tech...we’re still learning some of its functions and possibilities, but i can see some potential.  even my ‘technically challenged’ wife already figured out how to video call our daughter.', 'i like being able to tell alexia the music i want to hear, but sometimes she has trouble finding the song if i am

it!\", '', 'very happy', \"it's extremely useful in simple things like spotify and audible and things like that but sometimes it doesn't answer everything i ask but it's still nice to use.\", 'supberb

something else soon.', 'good but it’s pretty low', 'i set her up to play through our home theater system. so fat we are just using her for weather forecasts, cooking timers, and we really enjoy the music!', 'love it...so happy to have everything available through this', 'bought two of these. one for my kitchen and the other for my sewing room. its great if i need a recipe or need to know how to do something.  i am still learning everything it can do.', \"love!! i still haven't figured out all the best things we can do with it.\", 'outstanding product - easy to use.  works great', 'this is my second one. i have one in the kitchen and wanted another in my home office.it is amazing for a quick look up while i am working. i live a very busy life and it helps keep me on track with work and personal appointments.i will buy for holiday gifts for my whole family. the gift of organization and information at a voice command away.', 'works good for the most part. you ask it some questions and she says she doesn’t know. i thought she was supposed to know everything', 'i love my echo plus. i haven\\'t one bad thing to say. it controller music when i need it too. with a great sounding 360 speaker. i also bought a 4k fire tv and it can open amazon prime video or netflix at any moment. the included hue lighting makes this product even better. i found myself with a whole array of smart lights perfect for any house or entertainment room. the addition of phone calls on the mic and speaker makes it practical when your busy in the kitchen or on the computer. alexa will controll it all as soon as you say \"hey alexa\". and if the always on mic concerns you well you can always mute the device. this is a must buy for anyone interested in ease and comfort.', 'when you think about it

i was surprised by that. awesome.you will feel like tony stark on this device. i added quite a few &#34;skills&#34; like 'thunderstorm sounds' and 'quote of the day' . alexa always loads them up quickly. adding songs that you hear to specific playlists on amazon music is also a great feature.i can go on and on and this is only my second day of ownership.i was lucky to buy this for $100 on prime day, but i think for $150 is it pretty expensive considering the echo 2 is only $100. in my opinion, you will be paying a premium for the echo plus and you have to decide if the value is there for you:1) taller and 360 sound unit.2) volume knob on top that you spin (i think this is a huge benefit over buttons)3) built in hub for hue bulbs. after researching more, there are some cons to this setup if you plan on having more advanced light setups. for me and my floor lamp, it's just perfect.i highly recommend it and will buy an echo dot for my bedroom now.\", 'very cool and lots of fun!

from the 1990's and is downright ugly.  i have no interest on watching anything on these devices anyway, so the spot's screen does not bother me - although it is very clear.alexa can hear you from pretty much everywhere.  my favorite part about this is having it in our living room where it's hooked up to our bluetooth soundbar - where i can just say play any song i want and it will.  i guess i could just pick up my smartphone to do that, but you don't know how much easier it is to interact with media using your voice rather than navigating through multiple pages.the one thing that i am not a fan of is the home screen cards do not really rotate that much - they also do not rotate when playing music.  i'd love for it to display the weather as i listen to music.the screen is clear and i also really enjoy alexa being able to tell me how my commute will be - there is a great skill that you can download that will tell you traffic to 5 different places (that you program and name) so you can say alexa give me traffic to my parents - and she will tell you the best route and time you will arrive in current traffic.  i have this programmed for my parents, fiances parents, work, and her work.  so it really works great.the one thing that i actually preferred the dot over the spot is the dot will light up different colors when you have package notifications.. i have not seen the spot really do much for package notifications yet.  the dot it was very easy to tell when something was delivered.  i would recommend amazon do exactly what they did for the dot but on the spot - the dot lights up colors - why can't the spot ?  the same way you command alexa and you get that blue ring, just make that ring yellow when a package is updated for delivery.overall it's a great device that i

because i was worried about wireless speeds in my area, but thought i'd wait and see. glad i did. wireless connection has proved almost flawless so far. a few brief hiccups here and there, but i'm convinced that was from the apps themselves. don't miss the ridiculously high cable prices and am able to watch most of what i used to watch for a much lower price, which right now is a total of $50 a month. amazon fire stick is limited to 1gb of memory and 8gb of storage. thought that would be a huge issue when it came to downloading apps and recording shows. so far it hasn't been any issue at all. the upcoming fall tv schedule, which includes the return of nfl football, might prove more troublesome when i need to record more often. i'll worry about that then. my only real issue is that you can't really turn it off. the screen remains on and uses up electricity, although probably small amounts. luckily when you unplug it, all downloaded apps and recorded shows stay in memory. not sure what happens when you have something scheduled to record when it's unplugged. haven't tried it yet, although i don't think it'll be an issue with directtv now, which i'm using right now. so far i'm

in at all times to work. so i really don’t like that it’s not a stand alone device. also, the speaker is not very loud so if you are buying it as a bluetooth speaker, don’t. lastly, i’m sure the echo

edge on the volume department due to larger speakers. the new echo plus is priced lower than the original echo with the built in hub but i don't really need the hub with less functionality. in addition, i don't think that amazon will have software updates for this hub as other dedicated hub would have so bugs could end up never fixed. my philips hub gets software update probably once every

writing) raised the price to $39.99, so do your research before buying so you can get a good deal!set up with the dot went simple enough — plug it in, follow the app instructions... except initially it took a while to actually show up in my iphone’s wifi settings. i called amazon customer service, and i dunno what it is, but lately i’ve been getting terrible support. the guy that took my call just rambled off a (completely unhelpful) script and i ended up setting up the dot while he was in the middle of his spiel.i’m not sure if this is the norm or if it’s because this is refurbished, but the dot has a pretty finicky wifi range and randomly disconnects even though the app shows that the range of my 5ghz connection is strong. reconnecting is a pain each time as well.all that said, when alexa works, she works amazingly well. i don’t have a speaker hooked up to it, but one thing i really enjoy is the mic’s range and sensitivity. one of the more annoying limitations of apple’s siri is that when she’s playing audio through device speakers (music, podcasts, etc), the “hey siri” feature is all but useless. alexa has no problem hearing me over whatever is playing at the time, and with amazingly fast responsiveness too. i haven’t tried this with louder speakers yet, so i’m not sure if this will continue to hold true.setting up alexa to control all my wireless devices was a breeze, albeit with limitations — support for arlo devices is nil, and if you have special settings for your led devices (eg. rainbow effects), alexa can’t handle them, she only knows how to change solid colors and brightness levels.all in all, my rating would’ve been lower had i not gotten a decent price on this item. if the connectivity problems persist, i may have to exchange/return this item. i don’t want to though — alexa’s kind of growing on me.', 'this item did not work. certified refurbished should mean it works as advertised. instead this item crashed as soon as i turned it on and plugged it in. when trying to connect from my phone to the echo dot, it crashed, over and over. not only would it disconnect but the orange light would freeze and then the thing would reboot with the blue light. alexa would tell me it’s ready to connect and freeze mid sentence. tried holding the action button for 5 seconds and it didn’t do anything. returning immediately and hope they actually fix

and get my medical rides to and from hospitals, plays music on cue from multiple web apps, and watch videos, as well as communicating to my nurses aide my schedule and calendar of events. i wish there were programs that helped disabled people get these and smart lights. they are literally the best items since chocolate to assist the disabled and literally anybody else who need them. although the

you amazon. i will save up enough money to buy more gift cards from affirm.com to purchase 1 more of each and some lights for rest of the house. jeff bezos these are awesome items and because of your

them to a number of preset colors. you also cannot update the bulbs to the newest firmare which is a security concern for me.do not buy this if you want a full featured hub for your new iot devices.

as a hub.  it doesn't support z-wave and zigbee (which in fairness i knew in advance), but when the one protocol it does support doesn't do many functions that a dedicated one will, what's the point?

this when it came out. the screen is just so nice to have.the only thing resembling a down side is that it doesn't always perfectly understand which song i want to hear, but i do have a deep southern

it at bed time to listen to prime shows before bed, the screen is too small to watch shows..it displays my alarm in print so i know alexa heard me correctly. and you can make you own clock face with personal pictures.  my only complaint is that they don't add the stand as standard. i didn't need it for my spot at my desk but definitely needed it beside the bed.many people complain about the basic alexa program but it is still such new tech that i'm not going to split hairs.  the echo was not as good as my dot and the spot is better than dot.  alexa gets better over time and the skills are increasing weekly. now alexa even tells the difference between my son and my voice. i think amazon is working overtime on this project. i gave feedback to ask to be able to have self made lists and now you can make and name lists for anything.i am so used to my alexa that i talk to her even when i'm staying in a hotel and she's no where to be found.  alexa, what time is it?  alexa???!!\", 'it

a philip hue bulb.  the excited ended quickly.  i spend about a total of 4 hours attempting to add this bulb to my alexa echo plus.  everything i tried, ended in a discovery failed message.  i tried to set this up over and over and over again.  i watched youtube videos.  i read set up websites.  i was the poster child of insanity (doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results).the next day i went onto amazon to get the tech support.  i was hoping something would be done to make this thing work, but also the problem not being operator error.  well after 3 tech support staff and 1 hr. and 19 mins. of being on the phone, it still didn't work.  this product has tested my patience.  so far this experience is shifting my mindset from going to a smart home to just kicking it old school.the only reason i gave this two stars is because amazon will be sending me a different echo plus and light bulb.  the problem wasn't the bulb, because before packing up the items, i purchased another bulb and still alexa couldn't locate this device.i pray the next attempt is successful and then i will revise this rating, but what are the odds that i was shipped a defective echo?  the support person had the same thought.  maybe i should be exploring the google device but i can't get over the look of that hub.  it looks like a defuser.i can't believe i didn't find youtube videos that show the problems i did.  everything looked simple and seamless...not the experience i had.  ok, i'm done with this review because i spend enough wasted time this weekend already.\", 'overall it works very well. some connectivity issues but it was definitely worth the money!', 'works well i have several of these recommend to anyone', 'love it!! great product!!!', '',

didn't know was the z-wave lock and zigbee alexa hub weren't compatible.  does any body know of a lock that works seamlessly with echo plus?  if not, i guess my choices are: 1. exchange the plus for a regular echo and buy a separate hub like wink.  2. return the whole alexa system and get something else.i  don't want to just buy another hub to use along side my echo plus or i'll be back here asking

anything else to operate devices. well, not so. i understand there will be some differences in product device  support. the fact that it came with the hue light bulb works only for on /off/ dimming of the bulb. the bulb is capable of so much more with the hue app but the hue app does not recognize alexa hub as a bridge. so, it appears you do have to get a philips bridge to set the bulbs for scenes, time the lights when you are away, set color tones, etc. that can all be done via internet with your phone or tablet away from home. the list goes on for its capabilities but not without its own

order to turn off a repeating alarm in the morning you pretty much have to talk - which is not a thing you usually want to do when first woken up and your bed partner will definitely not like.  yes,

even if you really try to swipe to dismiss and ii) if you do manage to swipe up to dismiss, then you completely delete your recurring alarm.this is especially annoying as amazon could so easily fix this by simply making touching the screen turn off the alarm but not delete it or at least make it a setting to decide whether touching the screen for a recurring alarm snoozes or turns it off.  but

tivo to pause, stop and play whatever i want with a simple voice command. i love that i can reorder items that i purchased on amazon and that the echo plus notifies me when my order is mailed, when it will be delivered and when the package has been delivered.  the only three dislikes that i have is that if you’re up too close or to far the echo doesn’t respond. so i think they need to improve the microphone. and i wish the speaker was better. the speakers are okay but could be improved. also i have the echo dot and it never has given me any problems with the internet. well the other day i received a red light right on my echo plus. this error was sorry i’m having trouble understanding you please try again later. after research online i learned it was a problem connecting to my

works with echo show, but the cozi family’s doesn’t very well, amazon needs to go back to drawing board, it would be such a needed piece of technology, but it lacks the essential, please fix. cost of the echo show was  marvelous . got echo show to take on shopping list but that is all so far, adding items to list has long lag, and it not my router being slow, my provider speed is !gb, speed not a problem, but before new items is updated on cozi is very slow. help is needed to get it updated to a1 working conditioning.', 'very good quality', \"it takes a while to learn the uses and i'm still

problem is, there’s so much it can do that i haven’t been able to explore the extent of its abilities! i got the special price as part of the prime day promotion...and you just can’t beat what you get for the price.  very pleased with the sound. the video screen is sharp. sometimes it takes a few tries to get alexa to perform a command...but as i get to know the system better, i’m hoping that will improve.  one drawback in the music...i’ve noticed a lot of the songs from years past, are re-recordings by the original artist...but not the original recording itself.  example: secret agent man by johnny rivers...a “live”version is used, not the original version.  if i’m going to pay for prime music...i’d like to hear the original version of songs...not later recordings.  or at least give me a choice of what i want to hear.  otherwise, i am very pleased with my echo show.  so pleased in fact, that i bought a second one!']\n"
